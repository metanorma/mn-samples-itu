== Introduction

In July 1990, Study Group XV of the then CCITT (Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique) decided to set up a group to deal with the development of common software tools to help in the development of speech coding standards. In the same period, cooperation was requested with SG XII Speech Quality Experts Group (SQEG), and a group called 'User's Group on Software Tools' (UGST) was initially established with almost 20 corresponding members. The basic means of interaction were the then incipient electronic mail (e-mail) messages, for the exchange of files and experiences -- UGST was actually one of the pioneer groups in ITU collaborating via electronic means. In addition to this, there were meetings held mainly during regular Working Party XV/2 (Signal Processing) sessions, where most of the decisions were made.

As result of that very intensive work, several software tools evolved forming the '_1992 ITU-T Software Tool Library_' (STL92) which included, as its first application, the Qualification Test for a Speech Coder at 8 kbit/s. After this initial release, another release was approved by ITU-T Study Group 15 in May, 1996, and called STL96. The STL96 introduced substantive improvement and new features to the STL92. In November 2000, ITU-T Study Group 16 approved an updated version to the STL, the STL2000. In 2005, another updated version of the STL, STL2005, was accepted.

In 2009, a new version of the STL, STL2009 was developed. STL2009 corrects bugs and brings revisions (such as G.722 codec software, basic operators C-code, or reverberation tool), and adds new tools (more FIR filters, new EID tool, basic operator counters, floating-point complexity counters, and a stereo operator tool). Note that for STL2009 release, non-ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) encoded characters were substituted by ones in ASCII, for wider compiler portability. A potential bug related to memory leak in `ugst-demo.h` possibly caused by very long filenames is fixed. All files that make use of `GET_PAR_C()` macro is affected.

Approved in January 2019 under the responsibility of ITU-T Study Group 12, STL2019 incorporated new basic operators to accommodate state-of-the-art processor architectures which supports wide accumulators, SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) and VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word). Thus the new operators provide support for 64-bit accumulator, complex numbers, as well as enhanced 32-bit operations and additional control code operators. The software package was reworked to make it available as a truly open-source project hosted on an open-source collaboration platform: https://www.github.com/openitu/STL.

The STL2019 build toolchain is using CMake to generate platform-dependent and tool-dependent build scripts as well as to execute regression tests for each module in the STL. STL2019 modules have been tested on Windows, MacOS and several Linux flavors.

Terms and conditions on the usage of the ITU-T STL are found in Recommendation ITU-T G.191 <<G.191>>.

The remaining chapters of this document describe the principles that guided the generation of the ITU-T STL, as well as the description of its organization. The various tools are described in separate chapters. These descriptions have the following general outline:

. technical description of the method or algorithm involved;
. description of the algorithm implementation in this release (including prototypes, parameters, returned value, etc.); and
. testing, applications and examples.


=== Organization of the Software Library

Each tool of the STL has been produced as a stand-alone module, such that it may be linked to a user's program, application or system. In the present version, there are several of these modules:

*G.711*:: The 64 kbit/s PCM algorithm with A and stem:[mu] law of ITU-T Rec. G.711.
*G.711-PLC*:: The high-quality, low complexity packet-loss concealment specified in ITU-T Rec. G.711 Appendix I.
*G.726*:: 40, 32, 24, and 16 kbit/s ADPCM algorithm of ITU-T Rec. G.726.

*MNRU*:: The modulated noise reference unit of ITU-T Rec. P.810 (formerly ITU-T Rec. P.81).
*SVP56*:: The Speech Voltmeter for measuring the active speech level (which skips over silence in a utterance) of ITU-T Rec. P.56.
*REVERB*:: Tool to add reverberation to both mono and stereo speech and audio.

*BASOP*:: The set of basic digital signal processing (DSP) operators that represent instructions typically available in digital signal processors _(revised in STL2019)_.
*UTILITIES*:: Tools that have been developed to assure proper interfacing between the various tools. These tools do not relate to any ITU-T Recommendation. Included are tools for conversion between float and short data representations, between parallel and serial (bit-stream) formats, and for scaling of data.

It should be noted that C code is available for a number of codecs as a normative part of the respective standards, e.g. ITU-T G.711.0, G.711.1, G.718, G.719, G.722.1, G.722.2, G.723.1, G.729, G.729.1, enhanced aacPlus general audio codec; ETSI GSM-HR, GSM-EFR, GSM-AMR; TIA IS-641, IS-127, IS-96A, among others. These source codes are not appropriate for inclusion in the ITU-T STL for a number of reasons: they are an integral part of the respective standards, are maintained within the scope of the respective standards development organizations (SDOs), are protected by copyrights, and are openly available. Parties interested in acquiring these source codes should contact the appropriate SDO.

=== Whom to contact

In case of problems with any of the tools, please contact the ITU-T Study Group 12 secretariat at <mailto:tsbsg12@itu.int[]>. Please provide a precise description of the problem with proper reference to the C-code, and possible solution(s), if known.

=== Definition of terms

In the documentation of the ITU-T software tools, several terms are widely used and are defined below.

[[ovl-point]]
==== Overload point

The overload point within the digital domain is defined by the (normalized) amplitude value.

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
x__over overset(Delta)(=) 1.0
++++

How this overload point relates to the analogue world depends on the conversion method between the analog and digital domains, and is beyond the scope of this document. All signals in this manual are relative to this overload point in the digital domain.

NOTE: This overload point does NOT depend on the quantisation method used and remains identical, regardless of whether the quantisation is done e.g. with 32, 16, 13 or 8 bits.

[class=steps]
. In floating-point (either single or double precision) implemntations, the representation of this value is exact. In this text, and also in the tools, this data type is called `float`.

. In 32 bit 2's complement representation the data can be represented by multiplying the normalized value by 2^31^. For example, the largest possible positive value is represented by `0x7FFFFFFF`. The largest negative value is represented by `0x80000000`. In this text, and also in the tools, this data type is called `long`.

. In 16 bit 2's complement representation the data can be represented by multiplying the normalized value by 2^15^. For example, the largest possible positive value is represented by `0x7FFF`. The largest negative value is represented by `0x8000`. In this text, and also in the tools, this data type is called `short`.

. The statements above may be generalized for all wordlengths in fixed-point representation. The idea is to set the decimal point just after the MSb (sign bit).

==== Signal power

The power of a signal x(n) with a length of N samples is defined by

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
P = 1/N sum_(n=0)^(N-1) x(n)^2
++++

A signal which does not contain amplitude values exceeding the overload point can have a maximum signal power of 1.0. This is the power of a DC signal with an amplitude of 1.0 or of any other signal comprising only the values stem:[+- 1.0] (e.g., a square wave signal).

==== Signal level

The power level in decibels is defined relative to a reference power level stem:[P_0 = 1.0]:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
L = 10 log_(10) (P text(/)(P_0)) (text(dBov))
++++

The level of a signal power stem:[P = 1.0] is thus 0 dBov (where the characters "ov" arbitrarily mean digital **ov**erload signal level), which is chosen to be the reference level. A signal with such power level could be either (a) a sequence of maximum positive numbers latexmath:[(+1)], (b) a sequence of maximum negative numbers latexmath:[(-1)], or (&#x200c;c) a rectangular function exercising only the positive or negative maximum numbers latexmath:[(\pm1)]. The level of a sinewave with an amplitude (peak value) of 1.0 is therefore stem:[L= -3.01] dBov.

==== Relation between overload and maximum levels

The measurement of signal levels in the digital part of the network is normally expressed by telecommunications engineers as stem:[y] dBm0, i.e., the level relative to 1 mW in 600 stem:[Omega]. However, from the software point of view, it is more convenient to represent levels relative to the maximum power that can be stored in integer format on a computer, e.g. stem:[z] dBov. A conversion between both representations can be expressed as:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
y (text(dBm0)) = z (text(dBov)) + C
++++

For the G.711 encoding rule, a sinewave which exercises the maximum level has a power stem:[Tmax] of 3.14 dBm0 for A-law, and of 3.17 dBm0 for stem:[mu]-law. On the other hand, the RMS level of these sinewaves would always be -3.01 dBov. Therefore, stem:[C] above becomes 6.15 dB for A-law and 6.18 dB for stem:[mu]-law. For the G.722 wideband coding algorithm, the overload point of the A/D and D/A converters should be 9 dBm0. Therefore, in that case, C becomes 12.01 dB.

The following relationships summarize the discussion:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
Lambda_A (text(dBm0)) = L_(ov) (text(dBov)) + 6.15 dB (text(A-law))
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
Lambda_(mu) (text(dBm0)) = L_(ov) (text(dBov)) + 6.18 dB (mu-text(law))
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
Lambda_(wb) (text(dBm0))) = L_(ov) (text(dBov)) + 12.01 dB (text(G.722))
++++

==== Saturation

Saturation is the limitation of signal amplitudes to values equal to or smaller than the overload point:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
y(k) = {(-1.0",",if,x(k)<-1.0),(x(k)",",if,-1.0<=x(k)<=+1.0),(+1.0",",if,x(k)>+1.0):}
++++


==== Data representation

Unless otherwise noted all waveforms within the signal processing are assumed to have infinite precision and unlimited amplitude. The overload point is therefore the reference point only. In practice these signals may well be represented in 32 bit floating-point arithmetic or high precision integer arithmetic (24 bit for data and coefficients, 48 to 56 bit for products and accumulation). In most cases, 16 or 32 bit integer arithmetic is not precise enough.

Signals derived from 16 bit 2's complement representation (DAT, files, digital I/O interface) should be converted to this (approximately) infinite precision before processing by modules that require floating-point input. Normalization of the floating-point values to the overload point is recommended.

==== Data justification

Justification of data here is used without distinction to data alignment and data adjustment: where the upper or lower significant bit of an integer sample is located.

_Left-justified_ data are samples whose most significant bit is located at the leftmost position of the computer storage unit used for it. Remaining low-bit positions must be set to zero.

_Right-justified_ data are samples whose least significant bit is located at the rightmost position of the computer storage unit used for it. Remaining upper bits depend on the data representation: if two's complement, sign extension from sample's MSb to storage's MSb is needed; otherwise, the upper (unused) bits shall be zeroes.

As an example, suppose a 12-bit resolution, two's complement sample, to be stored for processing in a `short`. If left-justified, then a sign bit (the MSb!) is found in bit 15 (the MSb) of the `short` that stores it. On the other hand, if right-justified, the LSb will be the bit 0 of the `short`, in this case. If it is a negative number, there would be sign extension for bit 12 to 15. If it is an unsigned number, the upper 4 bits (in the example) are all zeros. <<justif-example>> illustrates these three cases.

==== Equivalent results

Several software tools, such as the G.711 algorithm, are defined in terms of precise fixed-point operations. Therefore, when comparing the output of one of these algorithms on different platforms, or for compilation using different C compilers, one should expect identical sample values for reference processed materials.

Other algorithms, however, may include highly intensive processing, or complex mathematical functions. Examples of these are rate change filters and floating-point arithmetic speech coders, such as the 16 kbit/s LD-CELP of ITU-T Rec. G.728. In such cases, it is expected that the processing of the same reference material on different platforms will generate almost identical results. The generated files will probably be identical for most of the samples,and for some samples they will differ by a small amount, e.g. latexmath:[\pm1], or more rarely by latexmath:[\pm2] or more. For the purposes of the STL, such an implementation is said to produce _equivalent results_ on different platforms.

==== Little- and big-endian data ordering

Present computer systems agree only on the data access for byte-oriented data structures. Although computer systems exist whose bytes do not have 8-bits, the majority of the systems implement bytes as 8-bit data structures. In general, the computer architectures do not differ in the way they access the bit-order within a byte. In other words, for the vast majority of the computer systems existing today, the least significant bit occupies the lower memory position (i.e., bit 0), and the most significant bit occupies the higher memory position in the byte (i.e., bit 7). In terms of C operations, if `b` is a byte structure, then `b&0x1` returns the LSb, and `(b>>7)&0x1` returns the MSb.

Although most computer architectures agree on the definition of a byte and how its bits are accessed, they vastly differ on how multi-byte structures are accessed. Trivial examples of multi-byte structures are 16-bit `short` words or 32-bit `long` words. There are currently two access means currently implemented by different CPUs in the market, which differ on the significance of the bytes that are first read from memory positions.

On the so-called _big-endian_ systems, the first byte read from a multi-byte structure is always the most significant byte. For example, if the two bytes 0x12 (low address) and 0x34 (high address) are stored in two consecutive memory addresses, then the number read and stored in the CPU accumulator would be 0x3412, or 13330 in decimal. The big-endian data organization is, for this reason, also known as _high-byte first_.

For the so-called _little-endian_ systems, the first byte read from a multi-byte structure is always the least significant byte. For this reason, the little-endian data organization is also known as _low-byte first_. Using the same example as before, for the two consecutive bytes in memory `0x12` and `0x34,` the value loaded on a little-endian CPU will be `0x1234,` or 4660 in decimal.

The concept is extended to other multi-byte data structures, such as 32-bit or 64-bit integers. For example, the consecutive bytes `0x12`, `0x34`, `0x56`, and `0x78` would be loaded as the 32-bit integer `0x78563412` on the accumulator of a big-endian CPU and as `0x12345678` on the accumulator of a little-endian CPU.

<<tbl-known-endian>> indicates the data organization for several computer platforms. It should be noted that the data organization is a function of the CPU family rather than of the operating system used. For example, Solaris on Sparc platforms uses big-endian data organization, while Solaris on Intel 80x86/Pentium platforms uses little-endian data organization. Similarly, most Linux systems are little-endian (because they run on Intel 80x86/Pentium CPUs), but several other implementations are actually big-endian (e.g. PowerPC CPU used in Macintosh machines).

The segment of C code in <<find-big-ltl-end>> can be used to determine whether a given computer system has big- or little-endian data organization.

  /* Hex version of the string ABCD */
  unsigned long tmp = 0x41424344;

  /* Compare the hex version of the four characters with the ASCII version */
  /* On big-endian (or high-byte-first) systems, 0x41 ('A' in ASCII) */
  /* is stored in the first memory position, and the equivalent string */

  /* stored in the last position, and the equivalent string will be */
  /* "DCBA". Function strncmp will return 0 if both strings are equal */
  /*  upto the first four characters. */
  return(strncmp("ABCD", (char *)&tmp, 4));
}

void main()
{
  printf("System is %s-endian\n", is_little_endian()? "little" : "big");
}
----

The approach above determines whether a platform is big- or little-endian, but it does not answer the question of what is the byte orientation in a given file. Although there is no closed-form method for such a determination, there is an empirical method that can be carefully used for speech signals (usually represented using 16-bit linear PCM words) based on two speech properties: speech signals follow a gamma distribution (hence most of the samples have small amplitude), and levels in voiced segments are usually in the -15 dBov through -40 dBov range. For files that have a byte orientation mismatching that of the computer platform, the mostly small samples of the speech signal will be measured as having large amplitude. Hence, if a high-level power is found when measuring the power of a voiced segment (typically around -4 dBov), one can assume that the file needs to be byte-swapped. It is important however to measure the level for _voiced segments_, since for silent intervals the increase in gain is not so dramatic and will not allow for a conclusion on the byte-orientation of the file.

When the change of format is necessary for `short` and `long` data, the operations in <<fig-cvt-big-ltl-end>> should be used. The conversion between big- and little-endian data representation for 16-bit data is simple and is known as _byte swapping_. The byte swapping operation can be implemented in several fashions. For example,

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
short swap_one_short(short in)
{
  return (((in>>8)&0xFF) | (in<<8));
}

It should be noted that the simple byte-swapping above does not work properly for conversion of other multi-byte structures. For the purposes of the STL, however, 16-bit structures is the most import case. For several of the STL modules, the provided test files in general need to be byte swapped in one or another computer platform. The documentation and the "manifesto" accompaining each software tool module describe which files, if any, should be byte-swapped on certain platforms. As default, binary files organized in 16-bit words are provided in big endian format in the STL distribution.

=== Guidelines for software tool development

The software tools provided by the ITU-T User's Group on Software Tools are to be used by laboratories with different computers and A/D-D/A equipment. To make the software accessible to everybody, it should be highly portable across operating systems and allow for easy implementation in existing hardware environments.

To achieve this, some simple guidelines were followed in the development of the tools. The following are the UGST guidelines used to generate the official and beta releases of the ITU-T Software Tool Library.

[type=i]
. All software should be written in ANSI C.
. Features of the language whose representation may create side-effects should not be used (e.g. `union`).
. All variables must be declared and the types used in the declarations must be the least platform dependent. For example, the keyword `int` must be avoided. Instead `short` should be used for 16-bit integers and `long` should be used for 32-bit integers.
. The software should not contain any input or output that may be system dependent (e.g. open, read and write file operations). Instead, data must be passed to the modules as parameters of function calls. This will allow each laboratory to integrate the modules with their own application software without changing the modules. Interfaces to various file formats and user interaction can optionally be provided as example main programs {blank}footnote:[Also called _"demonstration programs"_ in this manual.] that will not be a part of the library module and should contain the least possible amount of code.
. Well defined digital signal formats should be used and documented for each module to allow the various modules to work together.
. The interface to the file system should be made in a standard way, but only within the example programs.
. The source code should be properly documented, with a standard header.
. Modularity is encouraged in the software design. All modules are self-contained, i.e. global definitions should be avoided.
. Each module should have an attached specification document explaining the function and use of the module, the level of detail depending on its complexity.
. The software modules shall be distributed to interested laboratories for comments and testing before they are approved and included in the ITU-T Software Tools Library, to minimize the ocurrence of bugs and to assure conformance with related ITU-T Recommendations (when applicable). Two test procedures have been devised: compliance and portability.

The _compliance procedure_ (or compliance test) is to certify that a given tool module fully complies with specifications, which should be carried out by at least one organization other than the proponent organization (or by a group of organizations, each one checking a different subset of the specifications, such that all together cover all the specifications). In order to minimize the probability of systematic errors, these procedures should be defined by the verifying organization(s) without input from the tool provider(s).

The _portability verification procedure_ (or portability test) is to certify that a given validated tool works on platforms other than the one(s) where they were generated and validated. In simple cases these verification procedures could be just test vectors (e.g. speech or noise files). It was also pointed out that problems may arise in Unix platforms, due to the existence of several flavors of Unix available today (this means that a verification procedure could be valid in one Unix machine, but not in other).

Portability verification procedures should be provided by the proponents and shall be run on at least two relevant operating systems (DOS, UNIX). In the past, procedures for the VMS operating system used to be required, however this operating system has become less common. For DOS, the "pure" 16-bit mode has become less common, and 16-bit emulation window under a 32-bit version of MS Windows is now prevalent. These facts affect the choice of compiler.

The following is a list of compilers used to test the portability of tools in the STL, although not all tools were necessarily tested with all compilers.

_HP/c89_:: This is the `c89` compiler that can be purchased from HP for use in HP-UX systems. For the STL, tests with this compiler were performed with HP-UX 9.05.

_HP/gcc_:: This is the HP-UX port of the `gcc` compiler. The specific version may differ from tool to tool. Versions used included gcc 2.7.2.2 for HP-UX 9.05 and gcc-2.95.2 for HP-UX 10.20.

_MSDOS/gcc_:: This is the MSDOS-6.22 port of the `gcc` compiler version 2.6.3-DJGPP V1. This is a 32-bit compilation of the code, however using a 16-bit interface. Executables are not likely to run under Windows MS-DOS emulation window. Needs a run-time 32-bit extender called `go32.exe`.

_MSDOS/tcc_:: This is the Borland Turbo C++ Version 1.00 `tcc` compiler.

_MSDOS/bcc_:: This is Borland C++ `bcc` compiler. Versions used included 3.0 and 4.5.

_Solaris/gcc_:: This is the `gcc` compiler version 2.95 running under Solaris 7, usually in a Sparc platform.

_SunOS/cc_:: This is the basic `cc` C compiler bundled in the SunOS distribution. For the STL, SunOS version 4.1.3 was used.

_SunOS/acc_:: This is the licensed `acc` C compiler sold by Sun Microsystems. For the STL, SunOS version 4.1 was used.

_Win32/gcc_:: This is the `gcc` compiler version 2.95 running under Windows NT 4 SP 4 and with the CYGWIN Unix emulation interface. These executables need either the CYGWIN environment or the run-time library cygwin1.dll to run, and they are expected to work properly in a DOS emulation window under Windows 95/98 as well. This version will not run under native MS-DOS.

_Win32/cl_:: This is the command-line `cl` version 12.00.8168 C compiler of the MS Visual C V.6 SP3 running under the WinNT 4 SP4 (the executables will also run in Windows 95/98/SE/Me/2000). This version will not run under native MS-DOS.


=== Software module I/O signal representation

The idea behind the choice of the convention in this section is that all software modules within the ITU-T tool library should be independent building blocks which can easily be combined by connecting the output of one module to the input of the next module. With this characteristic, various systems may be very easily constructed. The individual software modules must have well-defined interfaces to allow such simple connections, especially at the I/O level. This convention is based on the following:

[class=steps]
. All modules work 'from RAM to RAM'. This means that the working modules are independent from physical I/O functions which are normally machine dependent. This approach also allows easy cascading of modules within one 'main' program.

. All signals at the I/O interfaces of modules are represented in one of the following ways:

.. in single or double precision (32 or 64 bit) floating-point representation. The normalized signal is used directly (_overload point = reference point = 1.0_)

.. in 32 bit 2's complement representation. The normalized signal must be multiplied by 2^31^ (i.e. the decimal point is just after the MSb, same as for 16 bit representation). If less than 32 bits are required, then the signal is left adjusted within the 32 bit longword and the LSbs are optionally set to 0.

.. in 16 bit 2's complement representation, as described in section <<ovl-point>>. If less than 16 bits are required, then the signal is left adjusted (left-justified) within the 16 bit words and the LSbs are optionally set to 0. If the host machine does not provide a format with 16 bit width, then the next longer wordlength should be used with the 16 bits right adjusted.

. Data exchange with a module shall be done directly within the calling statement (not by global variables).

. Data exchange with a module shall be done sample-by-sample (FIR-filtering, MNRU, etc.) or frame-by-frame (block oriented speech codec, etc.), whichever is more convenient. Larger blocks may be formed (e.g. 128 samples at a time) for better efficiency, however the block size should be rather small (less than 512). The block and its length shall be variables.

. All modules shall be constructed in a way that infinitely long signals may be processed with a reasonable amount of internal storage. As an example, the 'main' program could read a block of input data (e.g., next frame of time signal samples) from the disk, call a module or sequence of modules, write the output signal (e.g., next frame of coded parameters) back onto disk. This process is repeated for all the input data blocks of interest.

. All modules shall have
+
--
.. an initialization part (if necessary) and
.. a working part

The initialization part may be necessary to reset internal state variables, define the mode of operation (e.g. MNRU-mode), and so on. It is called only once at the beginning or whenever a reset to an initial state is needed.

NOTE: All state variables (if any) must be initialized at execution time, not at compile or load time.

The working part performs the processing itself. It leaves all state variables in a well-defined manner for the immediate use within the next call. One possible way to do this is to introduce a flag-variable within the call statement (e.g., named 'Initialize') which is set by the 'main' program to '1' for initialization and is set to '0' during normal operation. In this way, only one function for one module is necessary. Alternatively, a specialized initialization routine may be written, to be called before the main processing routine of the module. Only one of the approaches will be followed in the future. However, both are present in the current version of the STL.
--

. The RAM allocation shall in principle be split into 'static' and 'temporary' parts. 'Static' means that the contents must be saved from call to call, preferrably by means of state variables rather than truly static variables {blank}footnote:[As a rule, state variables should not be defined as truly static ones because this may cause side-effects.]. 'Temporary' means that the contents are not saved between sucessive calls of the module.

. All modules are separated in clearly and independently defined functions, but accompanied by an example 'main' program which may also include file I/O.

=== Tool specifications

For each tool, there are 'Requirements and Objectives' (R&Os) associated. Each of the R&Os has both a general and a specific part.

The general part includes the following {blank}footnote:[GL__x__ refers to the Guideline number _x_ in <<UGST-GLs>>, e.g., GLiii is the Guideline iii.]:

[class=steps]
. Portability among platforms and Operating Systems (DOS, UNIX, and VMS):
.. compilation [GL-i];
.. usage of language features that may cause side-effects [GL-ii];
.. usage of language features that may be ambiguous among platforms [GL-iii];
.. usage of system dependent calls (to access resources such as files, etc. within the modules) [GL-iv];

. Efficiency:
.. use of CPU (i.e., execution speed);
.. use of I/O (intensity of access to files, etc.);
.. use of memory (physical/virtual);
.. code's coverage (verbosity versus laconism);

. Documentation:
.. Self-documentation (e.g., comments, variables and structure resembling ITU-T Recommendations, etc.)[GL-vii];
.. Separate documentation (clarity, objectivity, etc.)[GL-ix];

. Modularity [GL-viii]

. Fixed- versus floating-point implementations;

Following are descriptions of each of the General R&Os. Full description of the R&Os can be found in <<COM-XV-R-73-E>>, Annex 4.

_General performance specification_ refers to the document that specifies the tool in question, e.g. an ITU-T Recommendation or ANSI or ETSI standard.

_Portability_ addresses several points related to the tool's capacity of working on several platforms: _Compilation and linkage_ refers to the necessity of changes in the source code to make a tool compile without any modification in a given environment. It was identified that the operating systems of most interest are DOS and Unix (both BSD and System V). _Side-effectable features_ are those that, if used in a program, when changing one parameter, may cause other(s) to be changed implicitly. _Ambiguous features_ are those that, due to the flexibility left in the C language specification, are implemented in different ways for different platforms. For example, `int` in C is 32-bit wide in VAX-C and Unix workstations, but is 16-bit wide for most compilers available on MS-DOS (Turbo-C/MS-C). _System-dependent calls_ are calls that are restricted to or are implementation of features of a particular platform, to make better use of that particular computer architecture.

_Efficiency_ is related to how the computer's resources are used in terms of CPU, I/O and memory allocation, that may be a burden and prevent the usage in some systems, either by lack of resources or length of time needed for execution. Efficiency also includes _code's coverage_, expressing how frequently code is accessed.

_Documentation_ refers to how to describe the tool. _Self-documentation_ is the documentation present in the program itself to assure that the code clearly describes the algorithm implemented, to provide compilation and linkage instructions, as well as to report known bugs, etc. A _separate document_ will be mandatory when no written description of the algorithm is available, or when the written documents that specify the tool are too general.

_Modularity degree_ is the degree of isolation that a particular tool has. From UGST Guidelines, all tools must be modular, i.e., self-contained blocks; nonetheless, tools may make use of system resources other than memory and CPU.

_Arithmetic_ is the number representation specification, either in fixed (2's complement, 1's complement, etc.) or floating point. Here, "fixed-point" shall always be understood as 2's complement representation, except where otherwise indicated.


== G.711: The ITU-T 64 kbit/s log-PCM algorithm

In the early 1960's an interest was expressed in encoding the analog signals in telephone networks, mainly to reduce costs in switching and multiplexing equipments and to allow the integration of communication and computing, increasing the efficiency in operation and maintenance <<Qual-meas-tel-sys>>.

In 1972, the then CCITT published the Recommendation ITU-T G.711 that constitutes the principal reference as far as transmission systems are concerned <<G.711>>. The basic principle of the algorithm is to code speech using 8 bits per sample, the input voiceband signal being sampled at 8 kHz, keeping the telephony bandwidth of 300--3400 Hz. With this combination, each voice channel requires 64 kbit/s.

=== Description of the algorithm

The idea behind the digitalization of the network involved a compromise: use as far as possible the existing infrastructure; this imposes a bandwidth limitation for the bit-streams of coded signals. A rate of 64 kbit/s was found to be reasonable.

If one thinks of using the most natural quantization scheme, one will choose linear quantization. But one drawback of this approach is that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) varies with the amplitude of the input signals: the smaller the amplitude, the smaller the SNR. And, from the quality point of view, if a signal has a wide variance, or a variance that changes with time (as in the case of speech signals), the SNR will also change, resulting in a wide-varying quality of the system.

To avoid this problem, one can use logarithmic quantization, which will result into a more uniform quantization noise. With this in mind, several studies were carried out in late 1960's to choose a good algorithm for this purpose. This led to the definition of two transmission schemes, one using the stem:[mu] law compression characteristic:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
c(x) = x_(max) (ln(1+mu:|:x:|:text(/)x_(max)))/(ln(1+mu))sgn(x)
++++

and the other using the A law compression characteristic:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
c(x)={((A:|:x:|:)/(1+ln(A))sgn(x),text(for),0<=( :|:x:|:)/x_(max)<=1/A),(x_(max)(1+ln(A :|:x:|:text(/)x_(max)))/(1+ln(A))sgn(x),text(for),1/A<=( :|:x:|:)/x_(max)<=1):}
++++

Both characteristics behave as linear for small amplitude signals (being then equivalent to a linear quantization scheme), but are truly logarithmic for large signals. In fact, for large signals the SNR is:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
SNR_(mu) = 6.02B + 4.77 - 20log_(10)(ln(1+mu))
++++

and

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
SNR_A = 6.02B + 4.77 - 20log_(10)(1+lnA)
++++

where stem:[B] is the number of bits used for quantization.

The ITU chose the values stem:[A=87.56] and stem:[mu=255] for the G.711 standard, together with 8 bits per sample, what leads the latter two equations to:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
SNR_(mu) = 6.02B - 9.99 = 38.17dB
++++

and

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
SNR_A = 6.02B - 10.1 = 38.06dB
++++

The G.711 standard does not specify the law as defined above, but rather uses a good linear-piecewise approximation for 8 bit samples, which has easier implementation (in hardware), as well as other properties (see <<Jayant-Noll>>,p.229).

This approximation uses bit 1 for sign (1 for positive, 0 for negative), bits 2--4 to indicate a segment, and bits 5--8 for level {blank}footnote:[Please note that the bit numbering in the G.711 is the reversal of the commonly used in computer languages, G.711's bit 1 corresponding to common-sense's (most significant) bit 7, and G.711's bit 8 to the normal least significant bit 0, respectively.]. Within each segment, the quantization is linear (4 bits, or 16 levels), having 15 segments of distinct slopes for stem:[mu] law, and 13 for A law.

The A law works with signals in the range from -4096 to 4096, implying in a range of 13 bits. As for the stem:[mu] law, the linear signals are accepted in the range -8159 to 8159, which is represented by 14 bits. Besides this, in the dynamic range sense, A and stem:[mu] law are equivalent to 12 and 13 bit linear quantization, respectively.

One detail for the A law is that the even bits are inverted. The reason for this comes from problems observed (before the standardization of the line code HDB3) in transmission systems when long sequences of zeros happen, because small amplitudes, in A law, to be coded mostly using '0' bits. With this bit-inversion, long sequences of bits '0' becomes less probable, thus improving performance.

The conversion rule for stem:[Atext(/)mu] law from/to linear is described in terms of tables in G.711. A good reason for this is that there is no closed form for the compression of linear samples (although it is possible to find a closed formulae for the expansion algorithm). Hence, two implementations are possible: table look-up, and algorithmic. For in-chip (LSI) implementations, the first one may be preferred, because it is simpler to implement, at the cost of a wider chip area. For other applications, such as using Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), or software implementations, table look-up would occupy too much memory, and the algorithmic solution would be preferred.

=== Implementation

This implementation of the G.711 can be found in the module `g711.c`, with prototypes in `g711.h`.

For the reason explained before, an algorithmic approach to the G.711 was followed. For the compression routines, first the samples are converted from two's complement to signed magnitude notation {blank}footnote:[Using the samples as two's complement in the compression algorithm is a very common error whose effects are only noticeable for small amplitude signals. Our approach agrees to the one in G.726 <<G.726>>, block _compress_.]. So, a segment classification is done, and then the linear quantization of a certain number of bits of the input sample, that depends on the segment number (e.g., for A law, segment 1 uses a factor of 2:1, 2 a 4:1, etc.) is carried out. Finally, the sign of the sample is added. The expansion routines are even simpler: find the sign, get the mantissa and the exponent, and compute the linear sample.

One important point here is that, following UGST Guidelines, linear input samples must be left-justified `short`s. With this approach, the knowledge of the 0 dB reference for the file is simplified, and the need of having to apply different normalization factors to files if they are to be coded by A or stem:[mu] law is eliminated {blank}footnote:[In the case of stand-alone tools, this would mean that two copies of the same file should be available!]. As an example, suppose that we want to process a speech file stem:[chi] by the G.711 at an input level of -20 dBov for both A and stem:[mu] law. Then, if the sample representation is right-justified, and a factor stem:[f] brings a file's level to -20 dBov for stem:[mu] law, then for A law the factor will be stem:[2.f], due to the difference in input signal's dynamic range of both laws (4096 and 8159, respectively). On the other hand, if the samples are left-justified, the factor is only one, and the routines will only look at the 13 or 14 most significant bits of the 16-bit word, for A and stem:[mu] law, respectively. In other words, the peak value for linear and stem:[Atext(/)mu] law is the same, therefore one factor is sufficient.

Compliance tests to this code have been done using a ramp file having the full excursion of the dynamic range for each of the laws, and examining the compressed and expanded samples against the values expected in tables 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b of Recommendation ITU-T G.711 (see <<G.711>>). Another test done exploits the synchronous property of the G.711 scheme. Only samples from column 7 of G.711 tables 1 and 2 were used. These values are transparent to quantization. Hence, if the coding was done properly, output samples should match exactly the original ones.

The compression functions are `alaw_compress` and `ulaw_compress`, and the expansion functions are `alaw_expand` and `ulaw_expand`. In the next part you find a summary of calls to these functions.

=== Tests and portability

Portability may be checked by running the same speech file in a proven platform and in a test platform. Files processed this way should match exactly. Source and processed reference files for portability tests are provided in the STL distribution.

These routines had portability tested for VAX/VMS with VAX-C and gcc, MS-DOS with Turbo C v2.0, HPUX with gcc, and Sun-OS with Sun-C.

=== Example code

==== Description of the demonstration program

One program is provided as demonstration program for the G.711 module, g711demo.c.

Program `g711demo.c` accepts input files in 16-bit linear PCM format for compression operation and produces files in the same format after the expansion operation. The compressed signal will be in 16-bit, right adjusted format, according to the logarithmic law specified by the user. Three operations are possible: linear in, linear out (_lili_) linear in, logarithmic out (_lilo_), or logarithmic in, linear out (_loli_).

== G.711 Appendix I: A high quality low-complexity algorithm for packet loss concealment with G.711.

=== Introduction

Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) algorithms hide transmission losses in audio systems where the input signal is encoded and packetized at a transmitter, sent over a network, and received at a receiver that decodes the packet and plays out the output. G.711 Appendix I <<G711-appendix-I>>, approved by ITU-T in September 1999, describes a high quality, low complexity PLC algorithm designed for use with G.711.

=== Description of the algorithm

A brief description of the PLC algorithm is given. A more extensive presentation can be found in Section I.2, "Algorithm description", of G.711 Appendix I <<G711-appendix-I>>.

The PLC algorithm is inserted after the G.711 decoder at the receiver. The algorithm is designed to work with 10 ms frames, or 80 samples per frame at 8 KHz sampling. An external mechanism is needed to signal when packets are lost. Since speech signals are often locally stationary, the signals recent history is used to generate a reasonable approximation to lost frames. If the losses are not too long, and do not land in a region where the signal is rapidly changing, the losses may be inaudible after concealment.

When a frame is received the decoded speech is given to the PLC algorithm. Received frames are saved in a 48.75 ms circular history buffer, and the output is delayed by 3.75 ms (30 samples).

When a packet is lost the concealment algorithm starts synthetic signal generation. First the pitch is estimated by finding the peak of the normalized autocorrelation of the most recent 20 ms of speech in the history buffer with the previous speech at taps from 5 to 15 ms. Using the pitch estimate, the most recent pitch period from the history buffer is repeated for the duration of the first lost frame (10 ms). If the pitch estimate is longer than 10 ms, only a portion of the most recent pitch period will be used in the first lost frame. A 1/4 pitch period overlap add (OLA) with a triangular window is performed at all repetition boundaries, including the transition between the last received frame and the start of the synthetic signal.

If consecutive frames are lost, the number of pitch periods used to generate the synthetic signal is increased by one pitch period at the start of the 2nd and 3rd lost frames. When the number of pitch periods is increased, the output is smoothly transitioned to the oldest used pitch period of the history signal with an additional 1/4 pitch period OLA. Increasing the number of pitch periods reduces the number of unnatural harmonic artifacts in the concealed speech for long losses. The algorithm does not distinguish between voiced and un-voiced speech and uses the same procedure for both types of speech.

At the start of the first received frame after a loss, the synthetic signal generation is continued and OLAed with the received speech. This OLA window length increases with the length of the loss. For single frame losses it is 1/4 of the estimated pitch period. 4 ms are added for each additional consecutive lost frame, up to a maximum of 10 ms.

If the loss exceeds 10 ms the synthetic signal is also linearly attenuated at the rate of 20% per frame. If the loss exceeds 60 ms the synthesized signal is set to silence.

=== Implementation

==== Introduction

The g711iplc directory contains an ANSI C implementation of the G.711 Appendix I PLC algorithm. The C++ version of this algorithm is in the `g711iplc\cpp_cod` directory. Sample test programs read lost frame patterns in G.192 file format and apply the PLC algorithm to audio files. The software in the `g711iplc` directory is covered by a more restrictive copyright than the STL. See the `copyrght.txt` file for details.

==== PLC Algorithm Implementation

A detailed line by line description of the C\++ code can be found in section I.3 "Algorithm description with annotated C\++ code" of G.711 Appendix I <<G711-appendix-I>> and will not be repeated here. The public interface functions that are called by applications are covered. The C\++ version is in the `g711iplc\cpp_code` directory (files `lowcfe.h` and lowcfe.cc). The ANSI C version, contained in the files `lowcfe.h` and `lowcfe.c`, is a translation of the C\++ code to C. The interface functions are the same for both versions, with the exception that the C versions of the routines take an extra argument for the data structure that is implicitly passed to C++ member functions in the class instance data. As for other STL modules, only the ANSI C version is compiled during STL2005 building.

===== Constructor

*C++ syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "lowcfe.h"
LowcFE  _lc_; // No argument constructor
----

*C syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "lowcfe_c.h"
g711plc_construct(_LowcFE_c*_); /* explicit constructor call */
----

*Description:*

Before the PLC algorithm can be called the data structure containing the algorithm's internal storage, such as the history buffer and buffer pointers, must be initialized.

===== Received Frames

*C++ syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
void LowcFE::addtohistory(short _s_); /* add a frame to the history buffer */
----

*C syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
void g711plc_addtohistory(_LowcFE_c*_, short _*s_);
----

*Description:*

Frames of speech received from the transmitter are given to the PLC algorithm with `addtohistory` function. The argument _s_ points to a short array of length FRAMESZ (80 samples, or 10 ms) that is used as both an input and output. Before the call is made _s_ is filled with the decoded G.711 data received from the transmitter. On return, it contains the data that is output to the listener. `addtohistory` performs several operations. It stores the input speech into the history buffer for use in generating the synthetic signal if a loss occurs. If this is the first received frame after a loss, an OLA is performed with the synthetic signal to insure a smooth transition between the signals. In addition, it delays the output so an OLA can be performed at the start of a loss.

===== Lost Frames

*C++ syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
void LowcFE::dofe(short _*s)_;    /* synthesize speech during loss */
----

*C syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
void g711plc_dofe(_LowcFE_c*_, short _*s_);
----

*Description:*

If a frame is lost, the `dofe` routine is called. As with `addtohistory`, _s_ is a pointer to short array of FRAMESZ samples. With `dofe`, _s_ is only an output. The PLC algorithm fills _s_ with the synthetic signal that conceals the missing frame.

===== Support Functions

`error`

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "error.h"
void error(char _*s_, ...);
----

*Description:*

Error handles fatal errors in the programs. The pattern string, _s_, and optional following arguments should be in the format of arguments accepted by the C library `printf` function. Error prints its argument message on stderr and then exits the program. The error function never returns.

`readplcmask_open`

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "plcferio.h"
void readplcmask open(readplcmask _*r_, char _*fname_);
----

*Description:*

The `readplcmask_open` function opens a G.192 format file containing a packet loss pattern. _fname_ is the file path. If successfully opened, _r_ contains the state information needed for reading the patterns. `readplcmask_open` internally calls the STL eid module to determine the type of the G.192 file and select an appropriate reading function. If the open fails or an unknown pattern is detected in the file, function `error` is called and `readplcmask_open` will not return.

`readplcmask_erased`

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "plcferio.h"
int readplcmask erased(readplcmask _*r_);
----

*Description:*

`readplcmask_erased` reads the next value from the opened G.192 format pattern file. It returns 1 if the frame is lost and should be concealed and 0 if the frame is ok. If the end of the G.192 file is reached, the routine seeks back to the beginning of the file and the pattern sequence is repeated. If an illegal value is found in the G.192 file, the error function is called.

`readplcmask_close`

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "plcferio.h"
void readplcmask close(readplcmask _*r_)
----

*Description:*

`readplcmask_close` is used to close a G.192 file that was opened with `readplcmask_open`.

==== Test Program

===== Test Program Usage

The PLC algorithm is tested using g711iplc.c. The PLC test programs take 3 file arguments:

[%unnumbered]
[source,sh]
----
  g711iplc mask.g192 input.raw output.raw
----

The `mask.g192` file contains the lost frame pattern and should be in the G.192 format as specified in the software tools library. The g192, byte, and compact representations are supported. The G.192 file should contain only the frame headers words (G192_SYNC or G192_FER, see `softbit.h`), and not the data words.

A frame corresponds to 10 ms, or 80 samples. If the lost frame pattern file is shorter than the number of frames in the `input.raw` file, the program will roll-over back to the start of the pattern file. For example if the `mask.g192` file contains the binary data:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21,
    0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B20
----

a 10% uniform loss pattern will be applied to the whole file. Erasures will occur at 90-100 ms, 190-200 ms, 290-300 ms ... in the file.

While the algorithm is designed for packets containing 10ms of speech, it can be applied to packetizations containing speech chunks that are integer multiples of 10ms. For example, for a 10% uniform loss pattern with 20ms packetization one could use:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21,
    0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21,
    0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21,
    0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B21 0x6B20 0x6B20
----

to cause erasures at 180-200ms, 380-400ms, 580-600ms, etc.

The input audio file, `input.raw`, should contain header-less 16-bit binary data, sampled at 8 KHz, in the native byte order for the machine running the test programs (big-endian on SPARC or MIPS, little-endian on Intel). The test programs do not contain the G.711 encoder or decoder. If you have a G.711 bit-stream, it must be decoded before the `g711iplc` program is run.

The output audio file, `output.raw`, also contains header-less 16-bit binary data. The PLC algorithm delays the output by 3.75 ms. The test programs compensate for this delay by not outputting the first 3.75 ms of the first packet. This way the input and output files will be time aligned if they are overlaid in an audio waveform editor. In addition, after the last full packet is input to the PLC algorithm, an extra zero filled frame is input, and the first 3.75 ms of the corresponding output frame is sent to the output file. The length of the output file will always be a multiple of the 10ms frame size. If the input file length is not an integral number of frames the last partial input frame will be discarded.

The test programs can also simulate a silence insertion algorithm instead of the PLC algorithm with the `-nolplc` option:

[%unnumbered]
----
  g711iplc -noplc mask.g192 input.raw output.raw
----

Instead of calling the concealment algorithm the lost frames are simply zero filled. This is helpful if you want to use a wave editor to view the location of the missing frames.

Use the `-stats` option to print out the number and percentage of frames concealed in the processed file.

===== Test Program Implementation

A simplified version of the C++ test program is shown next. This program does not support any options, such as `-noplc`, or compensate for the algorithm delay, but demonstrates how the components work together.

        fwrite(s, sizeof(short), FRAMESZ, fo);
    }
    fclose(fo);
    fclose(fi);
    readplcmask_close(&mask);
    return 0;
}
----

==== Loss Pattern Conversion Utility

The PLC directory includes a tool, `asc2g192`, for converting ASCII loss pattern files containing sequences of 0s and 1s into G.192 format pattern files. In ASCII loss pattern files, a "1" represents a lost frame and a "0" represents a received frame. For example, to create a 10% uniform loss pattern with each loss being 10ms, use a text editor to create a text file called `fe10.txt`:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
  0000000001
----

Then, convert it to the G.192 format for use by the g711iplc program with the following command:

[%unnumbered]
[source,sh]
----
  asc2g192 fe10.txt fe10.g192
----

Similarly, to create a 10% uniform loss pattern with each loss being 20ms (2 frames for each loss), create the text file `fe10_2.txt`:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
  00000000000000000011
----

Then convert it to the G.192 format with:

[%unnumbered]
[source,sh]
----
  asc2g192 fe10_2.txt fe10_2.g192
----

The `asc2g192` conversion program ignores new lines and carriage returns in the input file so the patterns can span multiple lines.

== G.726: The ITU-T ADPCM algorithm at 40, 32, 24, and 16 kbit/s

In 1982, a group was established by the then CCITT Study Group XVIII to study the standardization of a speech coding technique that could reduce the 64 kbit/s rate used in digital links, as per Recommendation ITU-T G.711 (see related Chapter), by half while maintaining the same voice quality.

After considering contributions received from several organizations, there was a general feeling that the ADPCM _(Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation)_ technique could provide a good quality coder. This process of finalizing an algorithm took 18 months of development and objective and subjective testings, to culminate in an ITU Recommendation, published in October, 1984, and available in the Red Book series as Recommendation ITU-T G.721.

Meanwhile, problems were found with the G.721 algorithm of 1984 regarding voice-band data signals modulated using the Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) technique, and changes had to be done to the algorithm. These changes were approved in 1986 and published in the next series of Recommendations of the CCITT, the Blue Book series, superseeding the Red Book version of the G.721. This is why a note in the Blue Book G.721 warns the user that the bit stream of coded speech from this version is incompatible with the old one. Also in that Study Period (1985-1988), a need for other rates was identified, and a new Recommendation, ITU-T G.723, was approved to extend the bitrate to 24 and 40 kbit/s.

In the Study Period of 1989--1992, these two Recommendations have been joined into a single one, keeping full compatibility with the former ones, and adding a lower rate of 16 kbit/s. This new Recommendation was named ITU-T G.726, and the former ITU-T G.721 and G.723 have been replaced.

The current version of the STL includes a G.726 implementation. In the section to follow, the operation of the G.726 algorithm is described only for the 32 kbit/s bit rate. A complete description of the G.726 algorithm can be found in <<G.726>>. Other analyses of the algorithm, besides some based on the Red Book version, can be found in several studies <<ADPCM-theor>>, <<ADPCM-over>>, <<ADPCM-Tech-Report>>.

Despite the change in numbering, the ITU-T ADPCM algorithm for speech coding at 32 kbit/s, the term "G.721 algorithm" has been retained for simplicity of the text, although a more formal reference should be _"G.726 at 32 kbit/s"_.

=== Description of the 32 kbit/s ADPCM

The basic idea behind the G.721 coder is to code into 4-bit samples the input speech-band signals, sampled at 8 kHz and represented by the 8-bit of G.711 A or stem:[mu] law samples. The decoder just implements the reverse procedure.

The ADPCM algorithm of the G.721 exploits the predictability of the speech signals. Therefore, an adaptive predictor is used to compute the difference signal stem:[d(k)] (based on the expanded input log-pcm sample stem:[s(k)]), which is then quantized by an adaptive quantizer using 4 bits. These bits are sent to the decoder and then fed into an inverse quantizer. The difference signal is used to calculate the reconstructed signal, stem:[s_r(k)], which is compressed (A- or stem:[mu]-law) and output from the decoder (stem:[s_d(k)]).

From this description, one could ask the following:

* If only the quantized signal is transmitted, how can the decoder reconstruct the signal?
* How can one assure estability of the predictor?
* Will this bitrate reduction degrade the voice quality?

These and others have already been considered in the design of the G.721, and many blocks of the algorithm are made to assure a good behaviour. For example, one possibility in this backward approach for adaptation is to have encoder and decoder starting from the same point, which is accomplished by reseting key variables to a known state (useful for implementation verification). Leak factors have been introduced to ensure that the algorithm will always converge, independently of the initial state. To avoid instabilities, some parameters had their range limited. To provide some insight in the building blocks of the G.721 algorithm, a short description of each of them is given <<G.726>>, <<ADPCM-over>>.


==== PCM format conversion

The input signal stem:[s(k)], in either A- or stem:[mu]-law format, must be converted into linear samples. This expansion is accomplished using the same algorithm in G.711 <<G.711>>, but converting from signed magnitude to 14-bit two's complement samples.

==== Difference Signal Computation

This block simply calculates the difference between the (expanded) input signal and the estimated signal:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
d(k) = s_l(k) - s_e(k)
++++


==== Adaptive Quantizer

A 15-level, non-uniform adaptive quantizer is used to quantize the difference signal. Before the quantization, this signal is converted to a logarithmic representation {blank}footnote:[Remember that to multiply samples in the linear domain one may add in the logarithmic one. Using efficient log and exponentiation algorithms (as done here), this turns out to be very advantageous.] and scaled by a factor (stem:[y(k)]), that is computed in the scale factor adaptation block (see below).

The output of this block is stem:[I(k)], and it is used twice; first, is the ADPCM coded (_quantized_) sample; second, is the input to the backward part of the G.721 algorithm, to provide information for quantization of the next samples. One relevant point to notice here is that the backward adaptation is done using the quantized sample. If one starts the decoder from this very point, one will find identical behaviour. That is why only the quantized samples are needed in the decoder (i.e., no side information).


==== Inverse Adaptive Quantizer

The inverse adaptive quantizer takes the signal stem:[I(k)] and converts it back to the linear domain, generating a quantized version of the difference signal, stem:[d_q(k)]. This is the input to the adaptive predictor, such that the estimated signal is based on a quantized version of the difference signal, instead of on the unquantized (original) one.


==== Quantizer Scale Factor Adaptation

This block computes stem:[y(k)], the factor used in the adaptive quantizer and inverse quantizer for domain conversion. As input, this block needs stem:[I(k)], but also stem:[a_l(k)], the adaptation speed control parameter. The reason for the latter is that the scaling algorithm has two modes (_bimodal adaptation_), one fast, another slow. This has been done to accomodate signals that in nature produce difference signals with large fluctuations (e.g. speech) and small fluctuations (e.g. tones and voice-band data), respectively.

This block computes two scale factor (fast, stem:[y_u(k)], and slow, stem:[y_l(k)]) based on stem:[I(k)], which combined using stem:[a_l(k)] produce stem:[y(k)].


==== Adaptation Speed Control

This block evaluates the parameter stem:[a_l(k)], which can be seen as a
_proportion_ of the speed (fast or slow) of the input signal, and
is in the range [stem:[0,1]]. If 0, the data are considered to be _slowly_ varying; if 1, they are considered to be _fast_ varying.

To accomplish this, two measures of the average magnitude of stem:[I(k)] are computed (stem:[d_(ms)(k)] and stem:[d_(ml)(k)]). These, in conjunction with delayed tone detect and transition detect flags (stem:[t_d(k)] and stem:[t_r(k)], calculated in the Tone Transition and Detector block), are used to evaluate stem:[a_p(k)], whose delayed version (stem:[a_p(k-1)]) is used in the definition of stem:[a_l(k)], limiting the range to [stem:[0,1]] {blank}footnote:[This limitation delays the start of a fast to slow transition until the average magnitude of stem:[I(k)] remains constant for some time; acting so, premature transitions for pulsed input signals, such as switched carrier voiceband data, are avoided.].

An analysis of stem:[a_p(k)] gives insight on the nature of the signal: if around the value of 2, this means that the average magnitude of stem:[I(k)] is changing, or that a tone has been detected, or that it is idle channel noise; on the other side, if near 0, the average magnitude of stem:[I(k)] remains relatively constant.


==== Adaptive Predictor and Reconstructed Signal Calculator

The adaptive predictor has as its main function to compute the signal estimate based on the quantized difference signal, stem:[d_q(k)]. It has 6 zeroes and 2 poles, structure that covers well the kind of input signals expected for the algorithm. With these coefficients, and past values of stem:[d_q(k)] and stem:[s_e(k)], the updated value for the signal estimate stem:[s_e(k)] is computed.

The two sets of coefficients (one for the pole section, stem:[a_i(k), i=1..2], other for the zero section, stem:[b_i(k), i=1..6]) are updated using a simplified gradient algorithm. At this point, since a situation in which the poles cause instability may arise, the two pole coefficients stem:[a_i] have their ranges limited. In addition, if a transition from partial band signal is detected (signaled by stem:[t_r(k)]), the predictor is reset (all coefficients are set to 0), remaining disabled until stem:[t_r] comes back to zero {blank}footnote:[Note that when this happens, the quantizer is forced into the fast mode of adaptation.].

The reconstructed signal stem:[s_r(k)] is calculated using the signal estimate stem:[s_e(k)] and the quantized difference signal stem:[d_q(k)].


==== Tone Transition and Detector

This block is one of the changes from the Red Book version. It was added to improve algorithm performance for signals originating from FSK modems operating in the character mode. First, it checks if the signal has partial band (e.g., a tone) by looking at the predictor coefficient stem:[a_2(k)], that defines the signal stem:[t_d(k)]. Second, a transition from partial band signal indicator stem:[t_r(k)] is set, such that predictor coefficients can be set to 0 and the quantizer can be forced into the fast mode of operation.

==== Output PCM Format Conversion

This block is unique to the decoder. Its sole function is to compress the reconstructed signal stem:[s_r(k)], which is in linear PCM format, using A or stem:[mu] law, and is a complement of the PCM format conversion block.


==== Synchronous Coding Adjustment

This block is also unique to the decoder. It has been devised in order to prevent cumulative distortions occuring on synchronous tandem codings (ADPCM--PCM--ADPCM, etc., in purely digital connections, i.e., with no intermediate analog conversions), provided that:

* the transmission of the ADPCM and the intermediate PCM are error-free, and
* the ADPCM and the intermediate PCM are not disturbed by digital signal processing devices.

==== Extension for linear input and output signals

An extension of the G.726 algorithm was carried out in 1994 to include, as an option, linear input and output signals. The specification for such linear interface is given in its Annex A <<G726-LinearIO>>.

This extension bypasses the PCM format conversion block for linear input signals, and both the Output PCM Format Conversion and the Synchronous Coding Adjustment blocks, for linear output signals. These linear versions of the input and output signals are 14-bit, 2's complement samples.

The effect of removing the PCM encoding and decoding is to decrease the coding degradation by 0.6 to 1 qdu, depending on the network configuration considered (presence or absence of a G.712 filtering).

Currently, this extension has not been incorporated in the STL.


=== ITU-T STL G.726 Implementation

The STL implementation of the G.726 algorithm can be found in module `g726.c`, with prototypes in `g726.h`.

Originally in Fortran (VAX Fortran-77), the source was translated by means of the public-domain code converter _f2c_ <<f2c>>. This explain why the code makes extensive use of passage of parameters by reference, rather than by value, and why many functions, that could be implemented as macros (using the C pre-processor directive `#define`), are routines, and as well as all routines return `void`.

The problem of storing the state variables was solved by defining a structure containing all the necessary variables, defining a new type called `G726_state`. By means of this approach, several streams may be processed in parallel, provided that one structure is assigned (and that one call to the encoding/decoding routines is done) for each data stream (this can be advantageous for machines with support for parallel processing). The G726 state variable structure has the following fields (all are `short`, except _ylp_, which is `long`):

_sr0_:: Reconstructed signal with delay 0
_sr1_:: Reconstructed signal with delay 1
_a1r_:: Delayed 2nd-order predictor coefficient 1
_a2r_:: Delayed 2nd-order predictor coefficient 2
_b1r_:: Delayed 6th-order predictor coefficient 1
_b2r_:: Delayed 6th-order predictor coefficient 2
_b3r_:: Delayed 6th-order predictor coefficient 3
_b4r_:: Delayed 6th-order predictor coefficient 4
_b5r_:: Delayed 6th-order predictor coefficient 5
_b6r_:: Delayed 6th-order predictor coefficient 6
_dq0_:: Quantized difference signal with delay 0
_dq1_:: Quantized difference signal with delay 1
_dq2_:: Quantized difference signal with delay 2
_dq3_:: Quantized difference signal with delay 3
_dq4_:: Quantized difference signal with delay 4
_dq5_:: Quantized difference signal with delay 5
_dmsp_:: Short term average of the stem:[F(I)] sequence
_dmlp_:: Long term average of the stem:[F(I)] sequence
_apr_:: Triggered unlimited speed control parameter
_yup_:: Fast quantizer scale factor
_tdr_:: Triggered tone detector
_pk0_:: Sign of dq+sez with delay 0

The encoding function is `G726_encode`, and the decoding function is `G726_decode`. There are 41 other routines that, grouped in individual calls inside the encoder and decoder, implement the algorithm. Therefore, none of these 41 routines are expected to be accessed by the user, and only the two main ones.

In the following part a summary of calls to both functions is found.

*Prototype:* `g726.h`

*Description:*

Simulation of the ITU-T G.726 ADPCM encoder. Takes the A or stem:[mu] law input array of shorts _inp_buf_ (16 bit, right-justified, without sign extension) with _smpno_ samples, and saves the encoded samples in the array of shorts _out_buf_, with the same number of samples and right-justified. An example of the sample packing for the G.726 encoded bitstream is shown in <<G726-bs>>.

The state variables are saved in the structure _state_, and the reset can be stablished by making _reset_ equal to 1. The law is A if _law_==`'1'`, and mu law if _law_==`'0'`.

*Variables:*

_inp_buf_:: Is the input samples' buffer; each `short` sample shall contain right-justified 8-bit wide valid A or stem:[mu] law samples.

_out_buf_:: Is the output samples' buffer; each `short` sample will contain right-justified 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-bit wide G.726 ADPCM samples, depending on the rate used.

_smpno_:: Is the number of samples in inp_buf.

_law_:: Is a char indicating if the law for the input samples is A (`'1'`) or stem:[mu] (`'0'`). See note below.

_rate_:: Is a short indicating the number of bits per sample to used by the algorithm: 5, 4, 3, or 2.

_reset_:: Is the reset flag (see note below):

* _1_: reset is to be applied in the variables;
* _0_: processing is carried out without setting state variables to the reset state.

Please note that this should normally be done only in the first call to the routine in processing a sample stream.

_state_:: The state variable structure; all the variables here are for internal use of the G.726 algorithm, and should not be changed by the user. Fields of this structure are described above.

NOTE: Please note the difference between _reset_ and _law_: _reset_ must be either 1 (0x01) or 0 (0x00), not '1' (0x31) or '0' (0x30), while _law_ is exactly the opposite.

[[G.726-Port]]
=== Portability and compliance

Code testing has been done using the reset test sequences for 40, 32, 24, and 16 kbit/s provided in the G.726 test sequence diskettes (available from the ITU sales department). Other tests were also done with speech files for the 32 kbit/s mode, comparing with reference implementations, most noticeably the one from AT&T Bell Laboratories, which is the original implementation. Both test approaches generated 100% compatibility of this implementation with the G.726. footnote:[The problem with the A-law 40 kbit/s test vector `ri40fa.o` present in the STL96 has been solved in the STL2000.]

The portability of the STL G.726 encoding function has been tested by feeding the routine with the reset test sequences of the G.726 test sequences diskettes (available from the ITU Secretariat). As inputs, a binary version of the files nrm.a, ovr.a, nrm.m, ovr.m have been used for the 4 bit rates; the output of `G726_encoder` was then compared with a binary version of the files rn__rr__fa.i, rv__rr__fa.i, rn__rr__fm.i, rv__rr__fm.i, _rr_=16,24,32,40, accordingly for each input sequence and rate. The encoding routine passed the test when no differences in the bit streams were found.

The portability test of the decoding function was carried out by feeding this routine with the pertinent test sequences of the G.726 Test Sequences Diskettes. As inputs, a binary version of the files rn__rr__fa.i, rv__rr__fa.i, rn__rr__fa.i, rv__rr__fa.i, rn__rr__fm.i, rv__rr__fm.i, rn__rr__fm.i, rv__rr__fm.i, and i__rr__ (twice: one for A and another for stem:[mu] law) have been used, __rr__ being 16, 24, 32, and 40. The output of `G726_decoder` was then compared with a binary version of the files rn__rr__fa.o, rv__rr__fa.o, rn__rr__fx.o, rv__rr__fx.o, rn__rr__fm.o, rv__rr__fm.o, rn__rr__fc.o, rv__rr__fc.o, ri__rr__fa.o, ri__rr__fm.o (__rr__ as above), respectively for each input sequences. All test vectors were properly processed.

These routines have been tested in VAX/VMS with VAX-C and GNU-C, in the PC with Borland C v3.0 (16-bit mode) and GNU-C (32-bit mode). In the Unix environment for Sun cc, acc, and gcc, and in HP for gcc.


=== Example code

==== Description of the demonstration programs

Two programs are provided as demonstration programs for the G.726 module, `g726demo.c` and vbr-g726.c.

Program `g726demo.c` accepts input files in either 16-bit, right-justified A- or stem:[mu]-law format (as generated by `g711demo.c`) and encodes and/or decodes using one of the G.726 bit rates (16, 24, 32, or 40 kbit/s). Linear PCM files are not accepted by the program. Three operations are possible: logarithmic in, logarithmic out (_lolo_) logarithmic in, ADPCM out (_load_), or ADPCM in, logarithmic out (_adlo_).

Program `vbr-g726.c` can perform the same functions as `g726demo.c`, however it is capable of two additional features. It can perform in variable bit rate mode, which is switched at user-specified frame sizes (i.e. number of samples), and it can operate from 16-bit linear PCM input files. In the latter case, A-law is used to compand the linear signal prior to G.726 encoding, since G.726 Annex A <<G726-LinearIO>> is not yet implemented in the STL.

==== Simple example

The following C code gives an example of G.726 coding and decoding using as input speech previously encoded by either the A- or stem:[mu]-law functions available in the STL. The output samples will be encoded using the same law of the input signal.

== G.727: The ITU-T embedded ADPCM algorithm at 40, 32, 24, and 16 kbit/s

=== Description of the Embedded ADPCM

The G.727 algorithm is specified in Recommendation ITU-T G.727 <<G.727>> with the block diagram shown in <<fig-G727>>, and will not be further described here. Additional information can be found in <<ADPCM-Tech-Report>>, where a thorough comparison is made between different ADPCM schemes, including G.726 and G.727. Details on the linear interface for the G.727 algorithm are found in G.727 Annex A <<G727-LinearIO>>.


==== Extension for linear input and output signals

An extension of the G.727 algorithm was carried out in 1994 to include, as an option, linear input and output signals. The specification for such linear interface is given in its Annex A <<G727-LinearIO>>.

This extension bypasses the PCM format conversion block for linear input signals, and both the Output PCM Format Conversion and the Synchronous Coding Adjustment blocks, for linear output signals. These linear versions of the input and output signals are 14-bit, 2's complement samples.

The effect of removing the PCM encoding and decoding is to decrease the coding degradation by 0.6 to 1 qdu, depending on the network configuration considered (presence or absence of a G.712 filtering).

Currently, this extension has not been incorporated in the STL.

=== ITU-T STL G.727 Implementation

The STL implementation of the G.727 algorithm can be found in module `g727.c`, with prototypes in `g727.h`.

The problem of storing the state variables was solved by defining a structure containing all the necessary variables, defining a new type called `G727_state`. As for other STL modules, the use of the state variable allows for parallel processing flows in the same executable program. The internal elements of the state variable `G727_state` should not be modified by the user, and are not described here.

The encoding function is `G727_encode`, and the decoding function is `G727_decode`. Additionally, initialization and reset of the state variable is performed by `g727_reset`. There are other internal routines which are not for access by the user, and hence are not described here. Their usage description is given below.

== G.728: The ITU-T low-delay CELP algorithm at 16 kbit/s

NOTE: The following description is only applicable to the basic G.728 operating mode, 16 kbit/s, both in floating-point (i.e. G.728 main body <<G.728>>) and in fixed-point implementation (i.e. G.728 Annex G <<G.728G>>). The packet loss concealment for the LD-CELP decoder (G.728 Annex I <<G.728I>>) is also described. The other bitrate extensions (G.728 Annexes H and J) are not part of this description.

CCITT, the predecessor of ITU-T, started an effort in 1985 to define a successor to then advanced ADPCM coding at 32 kbit/s. Due to the ample spectrum of its potential applications, extremely demanding requirements were defined for its performance <<Q21-ROs>>, which required quality at least the same as that of G.721 (later superseded by G.726 operating at 32 kbit/s) for one encoding, and a one-way delay under 5 ms (but preferably under 2 ms), to avoid the need of echo cancelers.

The process to identify the performance requirements and objectives (usually referred to as "Terms of Reference", or ToR) for the 16 kbit/s speech coder started in 1985 and lasted until about 1990. The process to identify suitable algorithms and their tests, after the creation of a group of experts in June 1988, started in March 1989, with two potential candidates: one from BNR (Canada) <<BNR-coder>> and another from AT&T (USA) <<LD-CELP-1>>. In 1989, BNR withdrew <<BNR-Letter>> its candidate, however another candidate appeared from the Consortium between a company called VoiceCraft (USA), University of California at Santa Barbara (USA) and Simon Fraser University (Canada), which would also soon withdraw <<Consort-Letter>>, <<LD-VCX-HLD>>, <<LD-VCX>>, <<LD-VCX2>>. This way, AT&T continued as the only candidate algorithm proponent in the CCITT standardization process.

Its algorithm, the LD-CELP _(Low-Delay Code-Excited Linear Prediction)_, underwent two testing phases (Phase 1 in 1989-1990 and Phase 2 in 1992) that were organized by volunteers from eight organizations <<Q026>>. After tests ensuring that it met all performance requirements, the LD-CELP algorithm was approved and published as ITU-T Rec. G.728 <<G.728>>. Its simplified block diagram is found in <<fig-G728>>.

=== General overview

==== General characteristics

LD-CELP modified the structure present in the classical CELP-type coders <<CELP-original>> to meet the performance requirements for the algorithm, as well as to allow its implementation in real-time. However, it kept the basic structure of CELP coders, which is the the search in codebooks using an analysis-by-synthesis approach.

Traditionally, an analog signal is digitized into a 64 kbit/s bitstream with 8 bits per sample (ITU-T Rec. G.711), hence a 16 kbit/s bitstream would be equivalent to quantizing using 2 bits per sample. Since LD-CELP uses a basic frame of five samples, this implies that the vector quantization codebook has 1024 vectors (represented by 10-bit indices). Each codevector is the result of a 3-bit scalar gain and a shape vector of dimension 5 (represented by 7 bits). The scalar gain has one sign bit and two magnitude bits, being symmetrical around 0. This allows doubling the range of amplitudes represented by the shape codebook without duplicating the search complexity for the optimal codevector.

The codebook was trained with the same perceptual weighting {blank}footnote:[The term _perceptual_ designates methods that explore the way the human hearing treats audio signals.] implemented in the codec, what takes into account the adaptation effect in the predictor and of the excitation gain; this has a better performance than populating the codebook with Gaussian random numbers, which was the traditional approach for CELP coders <<CELP-original>>.

After populating the codebook, indices are assigned to these values to organize the codevectors inside the codebook. To ensure a better SNR in the decoder for error-prone channels, a pseudo Gray coding was used for the indices. With this, a single error affecting the codebook index will shift it to a codeword very close to the original one, contrary to what would happen if the indices were randomly distributed.

==== Type of algorithm specification

The specification of an algorithm can be made in one of three methods <<LDCELP-VerProc>>: bit-exact, bitstream, and algorithm-exact specification. The bit-exact specification implies that all variables and operations inside the algorithm have the bit length and representation precisely defined; this is the type of specification historically used for ITU speech and audio codecs, e.g. G.722, G.726, and G.729. Another approach consists in only specifying the bitstream format (or syntax) and the decoder; additionally, it is common practice to provide a reference encoder and decoder, which can usually be modified to reduce complexity or improve performance. This type of specification was used for regional cellular codec standards in Japan and USA, e.g. VSELP, for video codecs, as well as in the MPEG suite of audio and video codecs. Finally, algorithm-exact specification implies in describing in detail all parts of the algorithm, without however specifying variable length or precision. An algorithm specification made in one of these three ways can additionally be defined in terms of fixed-point arithmetic (only integer variables) or of floating-point.

The original G.728 algorithm is specified in terms of floating-point operations. Therefore, it is a non-bit-exact specification that describes precisely the operations for its implementation <<LDCELP-VerProc>>. A fixed-point (albeit non-bit-exact) implementation of G.728 was subsequently designed to enable efficient implementation in digital circuit multiplication equipment, which maintained full interoperability with the original floating-point version {blank}footnote:[The concept of interoperability of two implementations of an algorithm comes as a consequence of algorithm-exact specifications. They refer to the need of two different implementations to speak to each other, even though the devices are different. For example, a floating-point DSP and a fixed-point DSP, or two floating-point DSPs of different manufacturers in which number representation has different precision. The small operation differences can cause the accumulation of errors that, as time goes by, can lead the two implementations to diverge, making them fail to interoperate <<LDCELP-VerProc>>.]. An implication of this approach is the need to define procedures for more sophisticated implementation and interoperability verification than the ones used for bit-exact algorithms.

Historically, the choice for an initial implementation in floating-point was only allowed due to the availability at the time of commercially available floating-point DSPs. Even though they are common place today, back in early 1990's this was a breakthrough decision. This was further motivated by the fact that it was uncertain whether the original time schedule and performance requirements could be met if the group were to pursue a fixed-point (possibly bit-exact) implementation. In retrospect, the quality and deadlines targets could have been met, but the safe approach was to go for a floating-point specification.

==== Delay

LD-CELP has an algorithmic delay {blank}footnote:[The total delay introduced by a codec can be defined as the delay intrinsic to the encoder, e.g. the number of samples that it needs to buffer _before_ it can start processing samples, plus the time needed by the hardware to process the samples or frame. For G.726 ADPCM, the algorithmic delay is zero, while the time needed to process the sample is non-zero but under 125 stem:[mu s]; this results in a total delay of one sample, or 125 stem:[mu s]. Obviously, the processing time is highly dependent on the implementation and cannot be determined _a priori_.] of 625 stem:[mu s] (five-sample frame) and a (total) one-way delay of less than 2 ms. To obtain this delay while keeping the required quality, the designers adopted a backward predictor adaptation technique.

==== Backward adaptation

In the traditional CELP approach, the excitation, the LPC coefficients and gain are transmitted, while with LD-CELP only the excitation is transmitted. For this to work, the LPC analysis is made with the quantized version of the signal and the excitation gain is updated based on the gain embedded in the samples previously quantized.

In the LD-CELP encoder there are three backward-adaptive structures: the LPC synthesis filter, the perceptual weighting filter and the excitation gain unit. In addition to these three structures, the decoder also has a backward adaptive post-filter.

==== Windowing used in the adaptation

In LD-CELP, except for the long-term post-filter in the decoder, all backward adaptive structures use LPC analysis. The LPC prediction coefficients are calculated using the auto-correlation method <<Rabiner-Schafer>>. In this method, windowing is necessary to increase the prediction gain.

Normally, a Hamming window is used, but this is not appropriate for LD-CELP. The LD-CELP analysis block has only 5 samples, compared to the conventional 160 to 256 samples normally used. Hence, using a Hamming window would imply a significant overlap of windows across frames and a high computational complexity <<LD-CELP-FixedPt>>. It was noticed that in the backward adaptation context of LD-CELP, the Barnwell recursive windowing technique <<RecursWind>> gave higher prediction gains than the Hamming windowing, in addition to a higher subjective quality for the processed speech. For this reason, the LD-CELP version tested in Phase 1 of subjective assessments used a modified adaptive windowing <<LD-CELP-Phase2>>, <<LD-CELP-RecurWind>>. This way, it was possible to obtain a better quality, a more balanced computational load and a lower complexity for frequent predictor updates <<LD-CELP-Phase1>>.

However, aiming at a future fixed-point implementation with minimal changes compared to the floating-point version (since interoperability was a requirement), a hybrid windowing technique was developed <<LD-CELP-FixedPt>>, <<G.728>>, with results equivalent to those of the Barnwell version {blank}footnote:[The prediction gain loss was below 0.1 dBm, a very small value.]. This was implemented in the version tested in Phase 2 of testings and today is present in G.728 (see <<fig-hybwin>>). With it, it was possible to keep the same quality (since the shape of both the hybrid and recursive windows is the same) while reducing the computational complexity between 20% and 30%. The objective was to reduce the complexity by mixing a recursive portion using the Barnwell technique with a non-recursive one, however maintaining the overall shape of the Barnwell window. The windowing was implemented such that the stem:[m] most recent samples are superimposed using the non-recursive portion of the window, and the samples previous to the stem:[m]-th sample are considering in the recursive portion of the window. This window has a characteristic that non-recursive part has a sinusoidal shape and the recursive part has a decaying exponential (so as to lessen the influence of older past samples).

In terms of equations <<G.728>>, <<LD-CELP-Phase2>>, the hybrid window
stem:[w_m(k)] is defined by:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
w_m(k)={(f_m(k)",",k<m-N),(g_m(k)",",m-N<=k<m),(0",",k>=m ):}
++++

where

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
f_m(k)=b alpha^(-[k-(m-N-1)]
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
g_m(k)=-sin[c(k-m)]
++++

and stem:[0<alpha<1], stem:[0<b<1] and stem:[c] are constants specific to each of the backward adaptive structures of the algorithm.

In the auto-correlation method, the i-th auto-correlation coefficient stem:[R_m(i)] of the input signal stem:[s(n)] is calculated as:

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
R_m(i) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty s(k) w_m(k) s(k-i) w_m(k-i)
++++

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
= \sum_{k=-\infty}^{m-1} s(k) w_m(k) s(k-i) w_m(k-i)
++++

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
= r_m^{\cal R}(i) + r_m^{\cal N}(i)
++++

Where latexmath:[r_m^{\cal R}(i)] and latexmath:[r_m^{\cal N}(i)] are respectively the recursive and non-recursive components of the i-th auto-correlation coefficient described by:

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
r_m^{\cal R}(i) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{m-N-1} s(k) s(k-i) f_m(k) f_m(k-i)
++++

and

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
r_m^{\cal N}(i) = \sum_{k=m-N}^{m-1} s(k) s(k-i) g_m(k) g_m(k-i)
++++

Considering a predictor of order stem:[M] with an adaptation (update) cycle of stem:[L] samples, the i-th auto-correlation coefficient of the next adaptation cycle will be:

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
R_{m+L}(i) = r_{m+L}^{\cal R}(i) + r_{m+L}^{\cal N}(i)
++++

with

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
r_{m+L}^{\cal R}(i) = \alpha^{2L} r_m^{\cal R}(i) +
         \sum_{k=m-N}^{m+L-N-1} s(k) s(k-i) f_{m+L}(k) f_{m+L}(k-i)
++++

and

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
r_{m+L}^{\cal N}(i) = \sum_{k=m+L-N}^{m+L-1} s(k) s(k-i) g_{m+L}(k) g_{m+L}(k-i)
++++

Therefore, it can be seen that latexmath:[r_{m+L}^{\cal R}(i)] is _recursively_ calculated from its value latexmath:[r_m^{\cal R}(i)] from the previous adaptation cycle and that the auto-correlation coefficients always have a recursive and a non-recursive portion.


==== White noise correction

The use of the auto-correlation method for the calculation of the LPC coefficients has embedded in it the calculation of the inverse of the auto-correlation matrix, even though this is not explicitly made in methods such as the Levinson-Durbin method, where the prediction (and reflection) coefficients are iteratively calculated.

However, these are equivalent operations, and if the auto-correlation matrix is ill-conditioned footnote:[The auto-correlation matrix can be ill-conditioned because the signal representation has a finite numeric precision.], the LPC coefficients calculated by the Levinson-Durbin method can lead to an unstable filter. This effect will be even more pronounced when high-order LPC filters are used, as in this case. A simple technique to reduce the matrix ill-conditioning consists in adding white noise to the signal on which the prediction will be made, since this will fill the spectral valleys with noise and would reduce the dynamic range of the spectrum. From the computational point of view, however, it is interesting to adopt an equivalent procedure, designated in G.728 as "white noise correction".

Let's consider a voice signal stem:[s(k)] whose auto-correlation function is stem:[R_s(i), i=1..M], where stem:[M] is the prediction filter order. In a synthetic notation,

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
s(k) harr R_s(i)
++++

Similarly, we can associate to a white noise signal stem:[n(k)] an auto-correlation function stem:[R_n(i)], or:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
n(k) harr R_n(i)
++++

If we add signal and noise, the resulting auto-correlation function stem:[R(i)] is:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
s(k) + G.n(k) harr R(i) = R_s(i) + G . R_n(i)
++++

where G is a constant designated white noise correction factor. The
SNR is given as a function of G:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
SNR_(dB)=20log_(10)(1/G)
++++

As stem:[n(k)] is a white noise, its auto-correlation function is given by:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
R_n(i)={(1",",if,i=0),(0",",,otherwise):}
++++

Consequently:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
R(i)={(R_s(0)+G",",if,i=0),(R_s(i)",",,otherwise):}
++++

This way, it can be seen that it is sufficient to add a certain value stem:[G] to the coefficient stem:[R_s(0)] to reduce the ill-conditioning of the auto-correlation matrix. The value of stem:[G] is defined by the level of noise that one wants to "add" to the signal.

In LD-CELP, this technique is used to, without increasing the computational complexity, add noise at approximately 24 dB below the signal level (stem:[G]=1/256) and lessen ill-condition of the auto-correlation matrix for the LPC synthesis filter and the perceptual weighting filter.

==== Bandwidth expansion

A common technique in CELP coders consists in attenuating the formant peaks through a bandwidth expansion of the LPC spectrum {blank}footnote:[Narrow bandwidth formants cause a chirping artifact that reduces the subjective quality of the signal. On the other hand, bandwidth expansion of the LPC synthesis filter can reduce performance with voice-band data, requiring therefore a compromise between voice and non-voice signals.]:

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
    a_i = \lambda ^ i \hat{a}_i
++++

where stem:[hat(a)_i] is the i-th coefficient calculated by the predictors and stem:[lambda] is a constant that satisfies stem:[lambda<1] and stem:[lambda ~~ 1].

The effect of the expansion is to move the predictor poles inside the unity circle. Additionally, the impulse response of the model gets shorter, reducing the transmission error propagation inside the adaptation mechanism.

==== Input and output formats

Since LD-CELP is an algorithm also designed for use in the PSTN, the input and output signal representation follows the ITU-T Rec. G.711 format (either A or stem:[mu] law) {blank}footnote:[For the implementation verification and interoperability purposes (see G.728 Appendix I), however, the input signal format must be linear. Therefore, the stem:[A text(/) mu]-law compression and expansion blocks must be bypassed.].

Since the internal algorithm operations are performed in linear PCM format, the first block in <<fig-G728a>> consists in the expansion of the log-PCM samples into linear format; complimentary, the last block in <<fig-G728b>>, after all decoding processing, does the compression of the linear samples into the selected log-PCM law.

=== Encoder structures

In the following, the LD-CELP encoder blocks are described, as illustrated in <<fig-G728a>>.

==== LPC synthesis filter

The synthesis filter uses LPC coefficients and has order 50, and generates the quantized signal from the de-normalized excitation vector. The reason for such a high order is explained below.

A very common technique used in speech coders, in particular CELP coders, is the use of long-term prediction, or forward-adaptive pitch prediction. Conventional LPC prediction is normally based on a small number of LPC coefficients (usually, 10 to 12 in narrowband speech signal <<Rabiner-Schafer>>,pp.419--420), what does not allow to do a long term prediction that takes into account the pitch period. The use of pitch predictors is needed to make whiter the excitation signal obtained after a conventional LPC analysis, thus better exploring the signal predictability. However, since LD-CELP only transmits the excitation information, the pitch prediction would also need to be backward-adaptive, as done in <<BNR-coder>>, <<LD-VCX>>. This technique, however, is very sensitive to transmission errors due to the high filter orders, what makes the errors to propagate over a large number of samples. The use of artificial re-initializations could solve the problem, but since the algorithm was required to operate at high bit error rates, e.g., stem:[10^(-2)] equivalent to 160 errors per second, this would not work for the LD-CELP <<LD-CELP-Phase2>>.

Together with the error propagation issue, it was noticed that the improvement introduced by the pitch predictor for female speakers was much higher than for male speakers {blank}footnote:[This is explained by two factors. First, since a male pitch period is much longer than for female talkers, the prediction gain is larger for the latter case. Second, backward-adaptive predictors use the _quantized_ error signal as input, instead of the original error signal. The resulting quantization noise further reduces the correlation within a pitch period for male voices. Consequently, the prediction gain is even lower for male speech.] <<LD-CELP-Phase2>>.

This way, with the problems of the backward-adaptive pitch predictor with transmission errors and the larger importance of the pitch prediction for female speech, it was decided to explore the predictability of the female speech using a high-order synthesis filter predictor, so that most of the pitch values for female speaker would be covered. It was then found empirically that an order of 50 for the LPC synthesis filter produced good results {blank}footnote:[Additionally, the backward-adaptive LPC predictor of order 50 showed to be more resilient to transmission errors than the backward pitch predictor.], replacing the "low order LPC predictor and pitch predictor" traditionally used in CELP coders.


==== Perceptual weighting filter

The general form of the perceptual weighting filter is <<Pond-Percep>>:

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
W(z)= { 1 - Q(z/\gamma_1) \over 1 - Q(z/\gamma_2) },
              0 <\gamma_2<\gamma_1\le1.
++++

where:

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
Q(z/\gamma_j) = \sum_{i=1}^M \gamma_j^{i} q_i z^{-i}, j=1,2.
++++

and stem:[q_i] are the quantized LPC coefficients and stem:[M] is the LPC predictor order.

Its function is to model the spectral envelope of the error signal, so that it becomes similar to the spectrum of the input voice signal, this way masking the distortion which, without this weighting, could be perceived by the user. By using the weighted error signal to select the codevector, this codevector will be the one that, on the decoder, will produce the lowest quantization noise perceived by the user, increasing in the decoder the subjective quality <<Expl-WeigFilt>>.

For CELP coders, (stem:[gamma_1,gamma_2=(1.0,0.8)] are normally used. In LD-CELP Phase 1 and 2, stem:[(gamma_1,gamma_2)=(0.9,0.4)] and stem:[(gamma_1,gamma_2)=(0.9,0.6)] were used, respectively, what resulted in a lower perceived noise level. Parameter stem:[gamma_2] was changed to allow the codec to meet the three transcoding requirement, condition for which the codec had failed the performance requirement in Phase 1 <<LD-CELP-Exp2-Phase1>>.

The predictor order stem:[M] was set here to 10 to avoid artifacts {blank}footnote:[_Artifacts_ denote here instabilities with quasi-periodic signals with long duration (more than 2 to 3 seconds), as happens with artificial voice signals (ITU-T Rec. P.50), some types of musical passages, e.g. sustained violin sound, or sustained vocalic sounds, e.g., `/a/`. These instabilities are reproduced as a change in the sound timbre this reducing the subjective quality.] that appeared with the use of higher order filters (e.g. 50, as in the synthesis filter). To compensate for the low order, instead of using a sub-set of the main predictor coefficients (which in principle could be the same computational structure), an independent predictor is applied on the input signal (noting that the main predictor operates on the quantized samples). This is justified by two facts: since the perceptual weighting is not necessary on the decoder, nothing obliges the prediction to be made on the quantized signal; and (more importantly) the use of the original signal allows the more precise calculation of the spectral envelope.

==== Search of optimal excitation codevector

For each sample vector stem:[s(n)], a search is made to find which of the 1024 codevectors generates the lowest (perceptually weighted) average quadratic error. The selected codevector has its index transmitted to the decoder and is fed back to the adaptive part of the encoder (a replica of the decoder inside the encoder), to be used as excitation for the synthesis filter. An efficient search algorithm was selected for the LD-CELP algorithm <<LD-CELP-Phase1-HQLD>>, <<LD-CELP-Phase1-Globecom>>, which is described in detail in the Recommendation <<G.728>>.

==== Denormalizing quantized excitation

To increase coding efficiency, the 1024 codevectors in the codebook represent typical excitation (obtained by training of this codebook from a large corpus of speech signals), whose amplitude has been normalized. Therefore the excitation vector to be used in the synthesis filter needs to be denormalized, which is done in the excitation denormalization block. The adaptation mechanism for this block is described below.


==== Adaptation of excitation gain

The optimal index transmitted to the decoder represents the normalized value of the excitation vector found for the input signal. Therefore, for the signal reconstruction (both in encoder and decoder), it is necessary to calculate the excitation gain value to be used for the denormalization of the excitation gain. This can be done using a fixed value pre-determined using a long-term statistical analysis of the possible gain values (similar to the fixed coefficient predictors and quantizers) of a large corpus of speech signals. A more optimal approach is to use an adaptive calculation of the gain. In LD-CELP, the calculation of the gain uses a mixed technique, which uses a fixed offset of 32 dB for the gain (empirically obtained), which is associated to a 10-th order LPC predictor using the auto-correlation method and hybrid windowing. This predictor adapts the gain around the fixed offset, in order to increase its precision.

The denormalized error signal stem:[e(n)] can be expressed in terms of the excitation gain stem:[sigma(n)] and the normalized error stem:[y(n)] by:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
e(n) = sigma(n) y(n)
++++

If stem:[sigma_y^2(n)] and stem:[sigma_e^2(n)] are respectively the mean square values of stem:[y(n)] and stem:[e(n)], then:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
log sigma_e(n) = log sigma(n) + log sigma_y(n)
++++

We can predict the excitation gain stem:[sigma(n)] from the past values of the denormalized gain stem:[sigma_e] using the predictor:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
log sigma(n) = sum_i^P p_i log sigma_e(n - i)
++++

Here, the predictor order is stem:[P=10].

It should be noted that this predictor, when combined with the last two equations, can be seen as a predictor with stem:[P] poles and stem:[P] zeros that uses stem:[log sigma_y(n-i)]as input:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
log sigma(n) = sum_i^P p_i log sigma (n - i) + sum_i^P p_i log sigma_y(n - i)
++++

The gain adaptation is backward-adaptive, as in other parts of LD-CELP. The use of the auto-correlation method for calculating the coefficients stem:[p_i] guarantees the stability of the filters above, what implies a filter response that falls asymptotically to zero. This limits the propagation of transmission errors, indicating a certain robustness of this block to transmission errors. This robustness brings the poles and zeros closer together, shortens the predictor impulse response and further limits the propagation of errors within the algorithm.

==== Adaptation of perceptual adaptation filter

To adapt the coefficients of the perceptual weighting filter the auto-correlation method is applied over the buffered (unquantized) input signal using a hybrid window, white-noise correction, and the Levinson-Durbin algorithm. The LPC coefficients are then multiplied by the factors stem:[gamma_1] and stem:[gamma_2], which define the degree of perceptual weighting.

==== Adaptation of LPC synthesis filter

The LPC predictor coefficients for the synthesis filter are adapted using the quantized input signal. Similar to the perceptual weighting filter, hybrid windowing, white noise correction and Levinson-Durbin algorithm are used (albeit with different parameters for the hybrid window and a larger order of 50 for the LP filter). After calculation of the LPC coefficients, these pass through the spectral widening and then are input to the synthesis filter.

=== Decoder structures

The decoder structure is found in <<fig-G728b>>. The blocks that are identical to ones in the encoder will not be described again. The few blocks unique to the decoder are described in the following.

==== Post-filter and its adaptation

A post-filter <<PostFilter-Basic>> consists of a time-variant filter put at the output of a decoder with the intention to improve the subjective signal quality.

Post-filtering, a technique very common in CELP coders, was not used in the first phase of testing for two reasons. The distortion introduced by post-filtering accumulates with multiple transcodings (tandem), what can compromise speech quality {blank}footnote:[The main distortion generated by post-filtering is the reduction of the bandwidth of the spectral peaks. Its accumulation causes severe distortion in the decoded speech.]. Besides that, post-filtering introduce phase distortions that can make it difficult to decode properly voice-band data that relies on phase to carry information (e.g. DPSK) <<LD-CELP-1-rev>>, <<LD-CELP-Phase1>>.

Since the Phase 1 algorithm did not pass the three-tandem connection condition, it was modified with introduction of post-filtering for Phase 2. However, the use of traditional post-filtering would imply unacceptable distortions for the reasons mentioned above. Then instead of optimizing the post-filter for each transcoding, it was optimized for three transcodings, thus implying a smaller amount of post-filtering for each tandem step <<LD-CELP-Phase2>>. This allowed the overall distortion added by the post-filtering to remain within acceptable levels, while the subjective quality for three transcodings saw a significant improvement (a 26% increase in the MOS scores). Even for a single transcoding there was a good improvement in the subjective quality. During the Phase 2 tests, the change showed to be a good compromise, increasing the subjective quality while maintaining a good performance for voice-band data.

The LD-CELP post-filter consists of three blocks: a long-term post-filter, a short-term post-filter and an automatic gain control (AGC).

The long-term post-filter (also called pitch post-filter), is basically a comb filter with a fundamental frequency being the reciprocal of the pitch period. This filter is described by the following equation:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
H_l(z) = g_l (1 + b z^(-p))
++++

where stem:[p] is the pitch period obtained by a pitch predictor and stem:[g_l] and stem:[b] are coefficients adapted from 240 buffered excitation samples. In LD-CELP, stem:[p] varies between 20 and 140 (57 to 400 Hz).

This way, when this post-filtering is applied to the synthesized signal, the spectrum regions around the multiples of the fundamental frequency are emphasized. This emphasizes pitch perception, thus resulting in a higher subjective quality.

The short-term post-filter, on the other hand, is used to reduce the audible coding noise by emphasizing the peaks and attenuating the valleys in the input signal spectrum. This is justified by the fact that perceptually the regions around LPC spectrum peaks, i.e. the formant regions, are more important than the regions around the valleys.

The short-term post-filter is implemented as a low-pass filter with the same number of poles and zeroes which cascades a first-order high-pass filter. The high-pass filter serves to compensate the muffling effect of the first low-pass filter. The general form of the short-term post-filter is given by:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
H_s(z)=(1-A(ztext(/)overset(~)(gamma)))/(1-A(ztext(/)overset(~)(gamma)))(1+mu z^(-1)), text( with ) 0<overset(~)(gamma)_1<overset(~)(gamma)_2<=1
++++

where:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
A(ztext(/)overset(~)(gamma)) = sum_(i=1)^M overset(~)(gamma)_j^ia_iz^(-i), text( for ) j=1,2.
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
mu = overset(~)(gamma)_3k_1
++++

and stem:[overset(~)(gamma)_1], stem:[overset(~)(gamma)_2] and stem:[overset(~)(gamma)_3] are constants, stem:[a_i] are the LPC coefficients, stem:[M] is the predictor order and stem:[k_1] is the first reflection coefficient.

It should be noted that the high-pass filter is implemented with an adaptive coefficient, the reflection coefficient stem:[k_1]. Therefore, the filter characteristics might not always be that of a high-pass. Long-term speech statistics measurements at the time of development of the algorithm using about 10 minutes of speech showed that stem:[k_1<0] for major part of time (around 92%) (see <<fig-distr-k1>>), thus guaranteeing that filter is a high-pass for the most part of the of the input signals.

[[fig-distr-k1]]
.Histogram of stem:[k_1] values for 10 minutes of speech
image::image7-3.png[]

In LD-CELP, the filter order of stem:[A(z)] is 10 and the stem:[a_i] coefficients, as well as the reflection coefficient stem:[k_1], are obtained during the adaptation of the decoder synthesis filter. Constants stem:[(overset(~)(gamma)_1,overset(~)(gamma)_2,overset(~)(gamma)_3)] were empirically determined as (0.65,0.75,0.15).

Finally, the AGC is responsible for making that the power of the decoded signal after post-filtering be approximately the same as before post-filtering. The AGC is calculated by the ratio of the average signal amplitudes before and after post-filtering. This avoids too much attenuation or clipping.

=== ITU-T STL G.728 Implementation

This implementation of the G.728 algorithm is composed of source files in several directories. The floating-point version of the algorithm can be found in the directory `g728/g728float`. The fixed-point version is in `g728/g728fixed`. A third directory, `g728/testvector`, is designed to hold the test vectors for both versions of the algorithm. The contents of the testvector directory are not part of the STL, but can be obtained from G.728 Appendix I on the ITU-T web site. Similar data structures and interface functions are defined for both the floating-point and fixed-point G.728 implementations. The floating-point interface is discussed first.

==== Floating-point G.728

The source code for the floating-point version of G.728 resides in the directory `g728/g728float`. All public interface function declarations and data structures needed to call the coder can be found in the header file `g728.h`. The package includes a demonstration program, `g728.c`, that shows how to call the encoder, decoder, and decoder with packet loss concealment. The demonstration program can run the coder on the G.728 test vectors.

The floating-point version of the coder can be compiled to use either double precision or single precision floating-point arithmetic. If compiled with `-DUSEDOUBLES`, `g728.h` defines the `Float` typedef as a C `double`. If compiled with `-DUSEFLOATS`, Float is a C `float`. `Float` is declared in `g728.h` as:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#ifdef USEDOUBLES
typedef double Float;
#endif
#ifdef USEFLOATS
typedef float  Float;
#endif
----

Single precision runs faster. Double precision runs slower but is more likely to give results that are bit-exact across different machines. When compiling for use with the test vectors double precision arithmetic should be used.

The include file, `g728.h` also defines a `Short` type:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
typedef short  Short;
----

to hold signed 16-bit integers.

==== G.728 Floating-point Encoder

`g728.h` defines a C structure, `G728EncData`, to hold the encoder state variables. Its contents are described in the G.728 standard. Here we emphasize how to use it, rather than its internal members. Before calling the encoder `G728EncData` should be initialized with a call to `g728encinit`:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
void g728encinit(
     G728EncData *e    /* encoder state, initialize */
);
----

Once initialized, frames of speech can be encoded with:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
void g728encode(
    Short       *index,  /* output indices */
    Float       *input,  /* input speech */
    int          sz,     /* input size - must be multiple of IDIM */
    G728EncData *e       /* i/o encoder state */
);
----

The `input` speech should be an array of `Float`s in the range of -32768. to 32767. `sz` is the dimension of the `input` array, and must be a multiple of the coder frame size, IDIM. IDIM is defined to be 5 in g728.h. `index` is the output of the encoder. It is an array of codevector indices that are transmitted to the decoder. `index` has dimension sz / IDIM, as one codevector will be output for each input frame of IDIM speech samples. Only the least significant 10 bits of each index value are set. The 3 bits of gain index bits are in bits 0 to 2 (0 being the least significant bit), and the 7 bits of shape index are in bits 3 to 9. Bits 10 to 15 in each index value are unused and contain zeros. If an application desires to compactly transmit the codevectors for multiple frames, it will have to extract the lower 10 bits from each index word and pack the bits.

The floating-point G.728 software package includes utility functions for converting between `Short`s (16-bit integers) and `Float`s:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
extern void g728_cpyr2i( /* convert Floats to Shorts,
                      * with saturation and rounding */
    Float *f,   /* input: float array */
    int   sz,   /* input: array size */
    Short *s    /* output: short array */
);
extern void g728_cpyi2r( /* convert Shorts to Floats */
    Short *s,   /* input: short array */
    int   sz,   /* input: array size */
    Float *f    /* output: float array
);

These are used by the test program, `g728.c`. A simple encoder loop that reads in frames of 16-bit linear PCM, encodes them with floating-point G.728, and outputs the index vectors is in the following code fragment:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "g728.h"

Short       ix;         /* output: index */
Short       s[IDIM];    /* input: 16-bit speech */
Float       f[IDIM];    /* converted to Float */
G728EncData e;          /* encode state */

g728encinit(&e);        /* initialize encoder state */
while (fread(s, sizeof(Short), IDIM, speechinf) == IDIM) {
        g728_cpyi2r(s, IDIM, f);        /* convert Short to Float */
        g728encode(&ix, f, IDIM, &e);   /* encode */
        fwrite(&ix, sizeof(Short), 1, indexf);  /* write to file */
}
----

We have omitted the details of opening the files. The code in the `(mode == M_ENC)` section of `g728.c` is a more complicated example that allows frame sizes that are multiples of IDIM, does more error checking, and also allows byte swapping of the input and output files.

==== G.728 Floating-point Decoder

`g728.h` defines a C structure, `G728DecData`, to hold the decoder state variables. Many of the decoder state variables replicate the state variables in the encoder. There are additional sections for variables associated with the post-filter and packet loss concealment. As with the encoder, the `G728DecData` must be initialized before it can be used:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
void g728decinit(
    G728DecData *d    /* decoder state, initialize */
);
----

Once initialized, frames of speech can be decoded with:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
void g728decode(
    Float       *speech, /* output: speech */
    Short       *index,  /* input: indices */
    int         sz,      /* input: size - must be multiple of IDIM */
    G728DecData *d       /* i/o: decoder state */
);
----

`speech` points to the output speech array. `sz` is the dimension of the output speech array. Like at the encoder, it must be a multiple of the coder frame size, IDIM. `index` is a pointer to the array of input codevectors. As with the encoder `index` should be dimension sz / IDIM. Five speech samples will be produced for each input codevector. The format of the index words is the same as in the encoder.

If the output speech is to be converted back to 16-bit linear PCM, the conversion routine should take care of rounding and saturation. The utility conversion routine, `g728_cpyr2i`, described above, takes care of this. Here is a code fragment that can be used to implement a floating-point decoder:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "g728.h"

Short       ix;         /* input: index */
Float       f[IDIM];    /* output: speech, Float */
Short       s[IDIM];    /* output: speech, converted to 16-bit int */
G728DecData d;          /* decode state */

g728decinit(&d);        /* initialize decoder state */
while (fread(&ix, sizeof(Short), 1, indexf) == 1) {
    g728decode(f, ix, IDIM, &d);     /* decode */
    g728_cpyr2i(f, IDIM, s);         /* convert to Short */
    fwrite(s, sizeof(Short), IDIM, speechoutf);
}
----

Again we have omitted the details of opening the files. The code in the `(mode == M_DEC)` section of `g728.c` is a more complicated example that allows frame sizes that are multiples of IDIM, does more error checking, and also allows byte swapping of the input and output arrays.

An additional interface routine, `g728setpostf`, allows the post-filter in decoder to be turned on or off. By default, the post-filter is on after initialization, but it can be disabled as required by several of the G.728 test vectors:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
void g728setpostf(
    int          i,     /* in: 1 postfilter on, 0 off */
    G728DecData *d      /* i/o: state variables */
);
----

==== G.728 Floating-point Encoder/Decoder

The following program fragment shows how to run the encoder and decoder together. It combines the fragment from the encoder, with the fragment from the decoder, and uses the utility functions to convert between Floats and Shorts. The loop sequence is: read in a frame of speech, convert to Float, encode, decode, convert the output from Float to Short, and write the resulting speech to a file:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "g728.h"

Short       ix;         /* index */
Short       s[IDIM];    /* 16-bit speech vector*/
Float       f[IDIM];    /* Float speech vector */
G728EncData e;          /* encode state */
G728DecData d;          /* decode state */

g728encinit(&e);        /* initialize encoder state */
g728decinit(&d);        /* initialize decoder state */
while (fread(s, sizeof(Short), IDIM, speechinf) == IDIM) {
    g728_cpyi2r(s, IDIM, f);       /* convert Short to Float */
    g728encode(&ix, f, IDIM, &e);  /* encode */
    g728decode(f, ix, IDIM, &d);   /* decode */
    g728_cpyr2i(f, IDIM, s);       /* convert to Short */
    fwrite(s, sizeof(Short), IDIM, speechoutf);
}
----

The code that opens and closes the input and output files is omitted.

==== G.728 Floating-point Decoder with Packet Loss Concealment

The floating-point code supports the Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) algorithm in G.728 Annex I. This algorithm generates a synthetic speech output at the decoder and maintains the decoder internal state variables if the input codevectors are lost in transmission. This feature is implemented with two more functions. The first PLC function:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
void g728setfesize(
    int    plc25msec,   /* input: PLC frame size, in 2.5msec */
    G728DecData *d      /* i/o: decoder state */
);
----

sets the PLC frame size, in increments of 2.5ms (20 samples). This function should be called after the G728DecData has been initialized with a call to g728decinit. If the PLC frame size argument, plc25msec, is set to 1, each lost frame will correspond to 20 samples. This variable: plc25msec should be in the range of 1 to 8, corresponding to a packet loss size of between 2.5 ms (20 samples) and 20 ms (160 samples). If the call to g728setfesize is omitted, the default PLC frame size is 10 ms (80 samples). The PLC algorithm uses state variables from the post-filter, so the post-filter must be activated when running the PLC algorithm.

The second PLC function:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
void g728decfe(
    Float       *speech,  /* output: speech */
    int         sz,       /* input: size, in samples, PLC framesize */
    G728DecData *d        /* i/o: decoder state */
);
----

is similar to the g728decode function except it takes no input index vector. It serves two functions: it signals the decoder that the current frame is lost, and it generates the synthetic output signal for the frame. The sz argument is the number of samples in the PLC frame size. Since there are 20 speech samples in 2.5 ms of speech, the sz argument to g728decfe should be 20 times the plc25msec argument passed to g728setfesize. For frames that do not have losses, the standard g728decode function should be called.

A code fragment that shows how to call the PLC functions for a 10 ms PLC frame size (80 samples) is shown below:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "g728.h"

Short       ix[80/IDIM];/* input: index vectors */
Float       f[80];      /* output: Float array */
Short       s[80];      /* output: converted to 16-bit speech */
G728DecData d;          /* decode state */

g728decinit(&d);        /* initialize decoder state */
g728setfesize(4, &d);   /* 4 * 2.5msec frames = 10 msec */
while (fread(ix, sizeof(Short), 80/IDIM, indexf) == 80/IDIM) {
    if (ferasedin())
        g728decfe(f, 80, &d);           /* PLC decode */
    else
        g728decode(f, ix, 80, &d);     /* normal decode */
    g728_cpyr2i(f, 80, s);             /* convert to Short */
    fwrite(s, sizeof(Short), 80, speechoutf);
}
----

As in the previous section, the details on opening the files are omitted. Function ferasedin() returns 1 if the current frame should call the packet loss concealment code, and 0 if the standard decoding routine should be called. The code in the `(mode == M_PLC)` section of `g728.c` shows a more complicated version of the PLC loop that supports setting of the PLC frame size from the command line.

==== Fixed-point G.728

The source code for the fixed-point version of G.728 resides in the directory `g728/g728fixed`. All interface functions and data structures needed to call the coder can be found in the file `g728fp.h`. The interface mirrors the floating-point version of the codec, although the routines and data structures have different names, and the input and output speech arrays are ``Short``s instead of ``Float``s. The fixed-point package also includes a demonstration program, `g728fp.c`, that shows how to call the encoder, decoder, and decoder with packet loss concealment. The demonstration program can run the coder on the test vectors. Please note that the fixed-point and floating-point test vectors are different sets of files.

The fixed-point G.728 algorithm internally uses double precision floating-point arithmetic to simulate some fixed-point operations. At the time this simulation was written, this sped up the run-time and allowed the coder to run in real-time on early Pentium-based computers. With today's 64 bit integer machines and faster processors, there are likely to be better alternatives for simulating accumulator guard bits. The fixed-point simulation code should generate bit-exact output for all the test vectors.

Rather than repeating the interface presented in the floating-point section, the <<tbl-G728-FX-FL>> lists the differences between the fixed-point and floating-point versions.

==== G.728 Fixed-point Encoder/Decoder

The program fragment below shows how to run the fixed-point encoder and decoder together. Speech is input from a file, encoded, decoded, and the output speech is written back to a file:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "g728fp.h"

Short         ix;       /* index */
Short         s[IDIM];  /* 16-bit speech vector*/
G728FpEncData e;        /* encode state */
G728FpDecData d;        /* decode state */

g728fp_encinit(&e);     /* initialize encoder state */
g728fp_decinit(&d);     /* initialize decoder state */
while (fread(s, sizeof(Short), IDIM, speechinf) == IDIM) {
    g728fp_encode(&ix, s, IDIM, &e);   /* encode */
    g728fp_decode(s, IDIM, &d);        /* decode */
    fwrite(s, sizeof(Short), IDIM, speechoutf);
}
----

This code closely resembles the code fragment for the floating-point code. Note that the input and output speech arrays to the encoder and decoder are Shorts so there is no need to call the Float to Short conversion routines. Input and output speech arrays are 16-bit linear full range PCM.

==== G.728 Demonstration Program

Both the floating-point and fixed-point versions of the G.728 coder software provide a demonstration program, defined in `g728.c` and `g728fp.c`, respectively, that can be used for four functionalities: encode, decode, decode with packet losses, and encode and decode a file in a single pass. Scripts are also provided to run G.728 on the test vectors. The test vectors themselves are not part of the STL. The floating-point version compiles the program into a binary called `g728`. The fixed-point version compiles into a binary called `g728fp`. Since the programs provide an identical user interface, we will only discuss `g728`. In the examples below, substitute `g728fp` for `g728` to use the fixed-point version of the coder.

The demonstration programs expect speech input and output files to be header-less, and contain binary 16-bit linear full range PCM. By default it is assumed that the files are in the native byte order of the machine. The byte order of the input and output files can be overridden on the command line with the options `-little` (for little-endian files) and `-big` (for big-endian files). When the -little or -big options are given, the software first determines if the current machine is a big-endian or little-endian machine. If the machine has the same endian characteristics as the requested file, no byte swapping is performed on the input and output files. If there is a mismatch, byte swapping is performed. For example, the G.728 test vector files are little endian files. Giving the -little option on Sun SPARC and MIPS processors (big-endian machines) will cause the input files to be byte swapped before processing, and output data streams to be byte-swapped before being written to files. On Intel processors, the -little option is a "no-op".

Bit-streams are in the format of the ITU G.728 test vectors. For every 5 input speech samples, a single 16-bit binary word is output. Only the least significant 10 bits of each 16-bit output word are used. The G.728 gain index (3 bits) resides in bits 0 to 2 (0 being the least significant bit), and the shape index (7 bits) resides in bits 3 to 9.

Input PLC mask files are ASCII files that contain '0's and '1's. A '1' implies the current frame is lost and should be concealed. A '0' implies the normal decoding routine should be called for the current frame. The PLC files may also contain newlines and return characters that will be ignored. If any other character occurs in the file, it is an error, and the program will exit with an error message. If the PLC mask file reaches the end of the file but there are still frames to decode, the PLC file will roll over and seek back to the beginning of the file. For example, a PLC mask file containing '00000000000000000001' can be used to introduce a 5% uniform loss pattern.

The demonstration program supports several other options. Options should appear in the command line before the mode of the coder:

`-nopostf`::
Turn off the post-filter in the decoder. This is required to run many of the test vectors. For normal operation the post-filter should be on.

`-stats`::
PLC concealment option to print out statistics on how many frames were processed and concealed.

`-plcsize msec`::
set the PLC concealment frame size, in milliseconds. This is how much speech will be concealed by a single lost packet. Only a limited set of values are acceptable: 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 and 20. The default value is 10 ms.

==== G.728 Demonstration Program Modes

The program has 4 modes: encode, decode, decode with PLC, and encode and decode. To run the encoder use:

[%unnumbered]
[source,sh]
----
  g728 enc speech.infile bitstream.outfile
----

To run the decoder use:

[%unnumbered]
[source,sh]
----
  g728 dec bitstream.infile speech.outfile
----

To run the combined encoder and decoder use:

[%unnumbered]
[source,sh]
----
  g728 encdec speech.infile bitstream.outfile speech.outfile
----

To run the decoder with Packet Loss Concealment with the default 10ms PLC frame size:

[%unnumbered]
[source,sh]
----
  g728 plc bitstream.infile plcmask.infile speech.outfile
----

==== G.728 Demonstration Program with Test Vectors

Scripts (`testall.sh` for Linux and Unix; `testall.bat` for Windows machines) are provided for running the demonstration programs on the the G.728 test vectors. The scripts use binary compare functions to see if the encoder and decoder output files differ from the expected results. For the fixed-point code an exact match is expected. For the floating-point code an exact match is not guaranteed. However, when compiled to use double-precision arithmetic (`-DUSEDOUBLES`) we have observed an exact match on all platforms we have tested the code on. If the floating-point code is compiled with the option `-DUSEFLOATS`, differences in the test vectors should be expected. For further details on the test vector verification procedure when the outputs do not match, please refer to G.278 Appendix I.

A script (`testplc.sh`, `testplc.bat`) is also provided to run the PLC algorithm on one of the test vectors. This program is only to demonstrate how to invoke the PLC algorithm, and does not compare the output with file. It is not possible to compare the outputs to a fixed file since the PLC algorithm uses a random number generator to extract the excitation when it determines whether a lost packet frame is in an unvoiced region of speech. Depending on where the packet losses occur, the output may be different for each run on the same file.


== G.722: The ITU-T 64, 56, and 48 kbit/s wideband speech coding algorithm

With the emergence of ISDN networks offering digital connectivity at 64 kbit/s between subscribers, the possibility was given to improve the standard telephone quality by increasing the transmitted bandwidth. A bandwidth of 50-7000 Hz corresponding to a sampling of 16 kHz was chosen because it provides a substantial improvement of the quality for applications where the speech is to be heard through high quality loudspeakers e.g. for audio or video conference services, commentary broadcasting, and high quality handsfree phones.

An expert group was created in November 1983 whose mandate was to define a standard for 7 kHz speech coding within 64 kbit/s. After many contributions received from several organisations, it has been decided to choose a coder which combined subband filtering and adaptive differential pulse-code modulation algorithms (SB-ADPCM). The final recommendation was produced in March 1986 and approved in July 1986 by the then CCITT SG XVIII as Recommendation ITU-T G.722 <<G.722>>.

The full description on the implementation of the G.722 algorithm is found in <<G.722>>, and network aspects related to its operation are found in <<G.725>>. <<fig-G722-systemic>> summarizes some systemic aspects of the G.722 algorithm. Overview and notes on the development of the G.722 algorithm can be found in several papers <<G722-General>>, <<G722-Overview>>, <<G722-SubjTest>>, <<G722-Implementation>>, <<G722-Modes>>, <<G722-Applications>>. The following description of the G.722 algorithm is based on the text in <<G722-Summary>>.

In 2006, upon ETSI DECT request, packet loss concealment (PLC) procedures for G.722 were standardized to ensure a sufficient robustness over the DECT wireless interface. ITU-T G.722 at 64 kbit/s codec is the mandatory coder in ETSI New Generation DECT (NG-DECT) standards (ETSI TS 102 527-1 and -3) <<G722-ETSITS102527-1>>, <<G722-ETSITS102527-3>>. These standards are intended for wideband audio enabled devices to be connected on VoIP networks.

In the above mentioned PLC standardization, G.722 software tool was updated. Originally, the ITU-T G.722 algorithm used its own binary bit stream format without synchronism headers; this made almost impossible to apply frame errors. In the STL 2009, G.722 codec software tool was made compliant with G.192 bitstream format and EID-XOR/G.192 style of frame and bit error application to G.722 is enabled. At the same time, STL basic operators and complexity counters were introduced. Furthermore, the standalone decoder tool now includes basic reference Packet Loss Concealment functionality.

=== Description of the 64, 56, and 48 kbit/s G.722 algorithm

In order to improve the transmitted speech quality, the input signal has to be converted after antialiasing filtering by an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter operating at 16 kHz sampling rate and with a resolution of at least 14 uniform PCM bits. Similarly, at the receive side, a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter operating at 16 kHz sampling rate and with a resolution of at least 14 uniform PCM bits should be used. The specifications of the transmission characteristics of the audio parts suited for the G.722 algorithm are described in the Recommendation. Some flexibility of the output bit rate was implemented to allow the opening of an auxiliary data channel within the 64 kbit/s channel.

[[G722-descr-encoder]]
==== Functional description of the SB-ADPCM encoder

<<G722-encoder>> shows block diagram of the SB-ADPCM encoder which comprises the following main blocks.

[[G722-encoder]]
.Block diagram of the SB-ADPCM encoder
image::image8-2.png[]

===== Transmit quadrature mirror filters

The input signal stem:[X_(text(in))] is first filtered by two quadrature mirror filters (QMF) which split the frequency band [0, 8000 Hz] into two equal subbands. The outputs stem:[X_(L)] and stem:[X_(H)] of the lower and higher subbands are downsampled at 8 kHz by the filtering procedure.

===== Lower subband ADPCM encoder

<<G722-low-encoder>> gives block diagram of the lower subband ADPCM encoder. To transmit the lower band, the encoder was designed to operate at 6, 5 or 4 bits per sample, corresponding to 48, 40 or 32 kbit/s, respectively. The ADPCM algorithm is very similar to the embedded ADPCM algorithm of Recommendation ITU-T G.727 <<G.727>>. It is an embedded ADPCM with 4 core bits and 2 additional bits. The embedded property was introduced to prevent degradation in speech quality when the encoder and the decoder operate during short intervals in different modes.


[[G722-low-encoder]]
.Block diagram of the lower subband ADPCM encoder
image::image8-3.png[]

===== Adaptive quantizer

A 60-level non-uniform adaptive quantizer is used to quantize the difference stem:[e_L] between the input signal stem:[X_(L)] and the estimated signal stem:[S_(L)]. The output of the quantizer stem:[I_(L)] is the ADPCM codeword for the lower subband. The 4 forbidden output codewords were primarily introduced to prevent the generation of all zero codes at all modes, but have also later been used to recover the 8 kHz content used by the coder.


===== Inverse adaptive quantizer

In the feedback loop the two least significant bits of stem:[I_(L)] are deleted to produce a 4 bit signal stem:[I_(Lt)] which is used for the adaptation of the quantizer scale factor and applied to a 15-level inverse adaptive quantizer to produce the quantized difference signal stem:[d_(Lt)].


===== Quantizer adaptation

In order to maintain a wide dynamic range and minimize complexity, the quantizer scale factor adaptation is performed in the base 2 logarithmic domain. The log-to-linear conversion is accomplished using a lookup table. There is no adaptation of the speed control parameter as in 32 kbit/s ADPCM <<G.726>> because the encoder is designed to transmit more than voiceband data.


===== Adaptive predictor and reconstructed signal computation

The adaptive predictor structure is similar to the one used for G.727 ADPCM standard: 2 poles and 6 zeroes. The two sets of coefficients (one for the poles and the other for the zeroes section) are updated using a simplified gradient algorithm. Stability constraints are applied to the poles in order to prevent possible unstable conditions. However, no predictor reset is applied for some specifics inputs conditions as it is done in G.726 algorithm. The reconstructed signal stem:[r_(Lt)] is computed by adding the quantized difference signal stem:[d_(Lt)] to the signal estimate stem:[S_(L)] produced by the adaptive predictor. The use of a 4-bit operation instead of a 6-bit operation in the feedback loops of the lower band ADPCM encoder and decoder allows for the insertion of data in the two least significant bits without causing mistracking in the decoder.


===== Higher subband ADPCM encoder

<<G722-high-encoder>> shows block diagram of the higher subband ADPCM encoder. This encoder is designed to operate at 2 bits per sample, corresponding to a fixed bitrate of 16 kbit/s. The encoder algorithm is very similar to the lower band one but with the following main differences. The quantizer is a 4-level non-linear adaptive quantizer. The higher subband ADPCM encoder is not embedded, hence the inverse quantizer uses the 2 bits in the feedback loop.

[[G722-high-encoder]]
.Block diagram of the higher subband ADPCM encoder
image::image8-4.png[]


===== Multiplexer

The resulting codewords from the higher and lower subbands stem:[I_H] and stem:[I_L] are combined to obtain the output codeword stem:[I] with an octet format for transmission every 8 kHz frame resulting in 64 kbit/s. Note that the 8 kHz clock may be provided by the network as it is always done for 64 kbit/s A-law or stem:[mu]-law log-PCM (G.711) systems.


[[G722-descr-decoder]]
==== Functional description of the SB-ADPCM decoder

<<G722-decoder>> shows block diagram of the SB-ADPCM decoder.


===== Demultiplexer

The demultiplexer decomposes the received 64 kbit/s octet formatted signal stem:[I_r] into two signals stem:[I_(Lr)] and stem:[I_(Hr)] which form the codeword inputs for the lower and higher subband ADPCM decoders, respectively.


===== Lower subband ADPCM decoder

<<G722-low-decoder>> shows a block diagram of the lower subband decoder. This decoder operates in three different modes depending on the received mode indication: 64, 56 and 48 kbit/s. The block which produces the estimate signal is identical to the feedback portion of the lower subband ADPCM encoder. The reconstructed signal stem:[r_L] is produced by adding the signal estimate to the relevant quantized difference signals stem:[d_(L,6)], stem:[d_(L,5)] or stem:[d_(L,4)], which are selected according to the received indication of the mode of operation.


===== Higher subband ADPCM decoder

This decoder (see <<G722-high-decoder>>) is identical to the feedback portion of the higher subband ADPCM encoder described in the Section <<G722-descr-encoder>>. Here, the output is reconstructed signal stem:[r_H].

===== Receive QMF

The receive QMF are two reconstruction filters which interpolate the ouputs of the lower and higher subband ADPCM decoders from 8 to 16 kHz (stem:[r_H] and stem:[r_L]) and generate 16 kHz sampling reconstructed output stem:[X_(out)]. Signal stem:[X_(out)] is converted to analog by the digital to analog converter of the receiving side.

==== Functional description of the basic Packet Loss Concealment functionality

In 2006, basic index domain PLC functionality (zero index and frame repeat algorithms) for detected frame errors were included in the standalone decoder tool. The numbering and description of the four basic algorithms provided can be seen in <<tbl-G722StandaloneDecoder>>.

[[tbl-G722StandaloneDecoder]]
.Basic PLC algorithms supported by the G.722 standalone decoder
|===
| PLC algorithm number | Description of concealment action
| 0 (default) | All bits in the erroneous frame are set to "1". (every 8 kHz octet index is set to 0xFF)
| 1 | same as PLC(0), but includes a decoder reset after the frame
decoding and synthesis operation.
| 2 | The bits from the previous frame(s) are repeated. After four erroneous frames, algorithm PLC(0) is used.
| 3 | as PLC(2), but the first (0.625 ms) bits of the first good frame after an erroneous frame are set to the value "1".
|===

The PLC actions in the G.722 standalone decoder are activated by incoming G.192 frames that do not have a valid G192_SYNC header tag. Note that in November 2006, ITU-T SG16 approved two new Appendices to G.722 for Packet Loss Concealment (PLC). These two Appendices (Appendices III and IV <<G722-AppIII>>, <<G722-AppIV>>) provide better quality over the basic PLC functionality included in
STL.

=== Standalone G.192 compatible G.722 encoder and decoder tool

==== G.192 bit stream format for standalone G.722 encoder and decoder

As described previously, G.722 is an embedded algorithm which supports network scaling of the bitstream in three bitrates: 48, 56 and 64 kbit/s. To support this functionality within the G.192 file format the G.722 encoder writes the 16 kbit/s embedded bits in the end of every G.192 bitstream frame.

For every 16 kHz sample, there are eight G.722 encoded bits (an octet index) to be transported in the G.192 frame. Bits b1 and b0 are the embedded bits and bits b2-b7 are the non-embedded bits. In a G.192 frame, the b2 bits are written first in chunk, followed by that of b3, until b7 bits. After all b7 bits are written, b1 bits are written and then b0 bits. By sorting bits in this manner, truncation of a G.192 type G.722 frame bitstream from 64 kbit/s to 48 or 56 kbit/s is made easy. <<fig-G722trame>>, <<fig-G722trame1>> and <<fig-G722trame2>> show how the G.192 frames are composed for various bit rates (64, 56, 48 kbit/s) and example frame sizes (10, 5, 20 ms). G.192 format is useful for enhanced simulation of G.722, however actual application transport formats may be different (e.g. as defined in <<G.722>> and as used in <<IETFRFC3551>>).

==== Standalone G.722 Encoder specific operation

If the encoder can not read a complete input frame it stops its processing, this means that the final decoder output file may be up to a frame shorter than the input speech file.

=== ITU-T STL G.722 Implementation

This implementation of the G.722 algorithm is composed of several source files. The interface routines are in file `g722.c`, with prototypes in `g722.h`. The original code of the STL G.722 was provided by CNET/France and its user interface was modified to be consistent with the other software modules of the STL. The update to make G.722 tool compliant with G.192 bit stream format and include basic PLC functionality was performed by Ericsson. The basic operators and complexity counters were introduced by France Telecom.

The problem of storing the state variables was solved by defining a structure called `g722_state` which containing all the necessary state variables. By means of this approach, several streams may be processed in parallel {blank}footnote:[This feature was not possible with the original code provided by CNET and was added in the modifications of the user interface.], provided that one structure is assigned (and that one call to the encoding/decoding routines is done) for each data stream (this can be advantageous for machines with support for parallel processing). The G.722 state structure has the following fields (which are all `shorts`):

_ah, al_:: Second-order pole section coefficient buffer for higher and lower band, respectively
_bh, bl_:: Seventh-order zero section coefficient buffer for higher and lower band, respectively
_deth, detl_:: Delayed quantizer scale factor for higher and lower band, respectively
_dh_:: Quantizer difference signal memory
_dlt_:: Quantizer difference signal for the adaptive predictor
_init_qmf_rx_:: Flag indicating the need to initialize the QMF filters on the reception (decoder) side
_init_qmf_tx_:: Flag indicating the need to initialize the QMF filters on the transmission (encoder) side
_nbh, nbl_:: Delayed logarithmic quantizer factor for higher and lower band, respectively
_ph, plt_:: Partially reconstructed signal memory for higher and lower band, respectively
_qmf_rx_delayx_:: Memory of past 24 received (decoded) samples
_qmf_tx_delayx_:: Memory of past 24 transmitted (encoded) samples
_rh[3]_:: Quantized reconstructed signal
_rlt[3]_:: Reconstructed signal memory for the adaptive predictor
_sh, sl_:: Predictor output value for higher and lower band, respectively
_sph, spl_:: Pole section output signal for higher and lower band, respectively
_szh, szl_:: Zero section output signal for higher and lower band, respectively

The default bitstream generated by the STL G.722 encoder is a G.192 compatible 16 bit output file and it is provided using the frame size specified by the -fsize command. Bits in a G.192 bitstream frame are ordered so that the frame can be truncated at 56 and 48 kbit/s. If the number of input samples are non divisible by the frame size, the output codeword stream is truncated at the last frame boundary.

A legacy g722 octet stream can be obtained using the option -byte. The legacy bitstream generated by the STL G.722 encoder has 8 valid bits for each encoded sample, saved in right-justified ``short``s. i.e., the codewords are located in the lower 8-bits of the encoded bitstream file. The MSB is always 0 for the 16 bit bitstream file. The lower 6 bits are the lower-subband encoded bits, and the upper two bits of the 8 valid bits are the upper-subband encoded bits. When the decoder is not in operation mode 1, the decoder will discard 1 or 2 of the lower bits of the lower-subband. It should be noted that, when bit errors are inserted in this bitstream and the operation mode is not mode 1, the actual bit error rate seen by the decoder may not be the one actually desired. One may consider that, in simulating a system where auxiliary data channels are used, such as modes 2 and 3, this is actually the desired behaviour, because errors hitting the auxiliary data will not affect the decoded speech quality. However, if simulation of modes 1-bis or 3-bis is intended, then the some of the errors hitting the lower 1 (mode 1-bis) or 2 bits (mode 3-bis) will not be seen by the decoder, and the overall bit error rate will actually be smaller than the desired one. There are two possible approaches to circumvent this problem:

* the use of an external program to shift the bitstream samples one or two bits (respectively for modes 1-bis or 3-bis) to the right before the bitstream serialization process for use with the STL EID module, and an external program to left-shift the bitream samples by one or two bits after error insertion and before using the STL G.722 decoder. This solution is valid for both random and burst bit errors.
* to increase proportionally the bit error rate by 1/8 (mode 1-bis) or 1/4 (mode 3-bis), to statistically compensate for errors hitting unused bits. This solution is valid only for random bit errors.

From the users' perspective, the encoding function is `g722_encode`, and the decoding function is `g722_decode`. Before using these functions, state variables for the encoder and the decoder must be initialized respectively by `g722_reset_encoder` and `g722_reset_decoder`. It should be noted that encoder and decoder need individual state variables to work properly.

In the following part a summary of calls to the three entry functions is found.

=== Portability and compliance

The portability test for these routines has been performed using the test sequences designed by the ITU-T for the G.722 algorithm {blank}footnote:[The G.722 test sequences are freely downloadable from http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.722-198703-I!AppII/en.]. It should be noted that the G.722 test sequences are not designed to test the QMF filters, but only to exercise the upper and lower band encoder and decoder ADPCM algorithms. Therefore, testing of the codec with the test sequences was done with a special set of test programs that used the core G.722 upper- and lower-band ADPCM coding and decoding functions. All test sequences were correctly processed.

This module has been compiled and tested on PC platform with Cygwin (CYGWIN_NT-5.0), using gcc(3.3.3), and with Microsoft Visual Studio 8.

Please note that the 16 bit oriented G.192 files require correct octet swapping of inputs and outputs on big/little-endian machines.

=== Example code

==== Description of the demonstration programs

One demonstration program is provided for the G.722 module, g722demo.c. In addition, two programs are provided in the distribution when compliance testing of the encoder and decoder is necessary, `tstcg722.c` and tstdg722.c{blank}footnote:[. The demonstration program `g722demo.c` cannot be used for compliance verification because the test vectors for G.722 do not foresee processing through the quadrature mirror filters.].

Program `g722demo.c` accepts 16-bit, linear PCM samples sampled at 16 kHz as encoder input. The decoder also produces files in the same format. The bitstream signals out of the encoder are always organized in 16-bit, right-justified words that use the lower 8 bits (i.e., 64 kbit/s). According to the user-specified mode, the decoder will decode the G.722-encoded bitstream using 64, 56, or 48 kbit/s (i.e. full 8 bits, discard 1 bit of the lower band, or discard 2 bits of the lower band). It should be noted that the demonstration programs `g722demo.c`, `tstcg722.c` and `tstdg722.c` only produce G.722 legacy bitstream. To produce bitstream compliant with G.192, please use `encg722.c` and decg722.c. Similarly, basic PLC functionnality is not supported the demonstration programs g722demo.cand tstdg722.c. Please use `decg722.c` for basic PLC functionnality.

== RPE-LTP: The full-rate GSM codec

In 1988, the Groupe Special Mobile of the Conference Europeéne des Postes et Telecommunications (CEPT) approved the first generation of a pan-European digital cellular radio system operating at a net rate of 13 kbit/s {blank}footnote:[The GSM standard developed initially under the responsability of the CEPT was later transferred to the European Standardisation Telecommunications Institute (ETSI), and the acronym GSM had its meaning changed to Global System for Mobile Communications. Currently, the GSM specifications are being maintained by the Third Generation Partnership Project, 3GPP (www.3gpp.org).]. Its speech coding algorithm, the RPE-LTP (Regular Pulse Excitation, Long Term Predictor) was a compromise solution of the two best coders at that stage. The full-rate GSM system started operation in the beginning of 1992 in some European countries and its expansion is expected in a mid-term. This coder, despite not being an ITU-T standard, is relevant for standardization studies when scenarios involving tandeming conditions between the PSTN and the European cellular system need to be studied.

The current version of the STL includes a RPE-LTP implementation based on a freely available implementation originally produced at the Technical Institue of the University of Berlin, for a Unix environment. This code has been adapted, corrected to work on several platforms, and tested with the recommended test vectors, all properly processed.

Details on the algorithm can be found in several references <<RPELTP-BasicConcept>>, <<RPELTP-ICASSP88>>, <<RPELTP-SpeechCommunication>>, besides the Recommendation itself <<GSM-06.10>>.

[[principles]]
=== Description of the 13 kbit/s RPE-LTP algorithm

The RPE-LTP is a frame based coder, encoding 20 ms frames of input data at a time. The encoder converts each 160 sample frame (8 kHz sampling rate, 13 bits uniform PCM format) into a bitstream frame of 260 bits. The decoder uses the 260 bitstream bits to generate a frame of 160 reconstructed speech samples.


==== RPE-LTP Encoder

A simplified block diagram of the RPE-LTP encoder <<GSM-06.10>> is shown in <<rpe-encoder>>.

[[rpe-encoder]]
.Simplified block diagram of the RPE-LTP encoder
image::image9-1.png[]

The input speech frame, consisting of 160 uniform 13 bits PCM signal samples, is first pre-processed to produce an offset-free signal, which is then subjected to a first-order pre-emphasis filter. The 160 samples obtained are then analyzed to determine the coefficients for the short-term analysis filter (LPC analysis). Using these coefficients for the filtering of the same 160 samples produce the 160 samples of the short-term residual signal. The filter parameters are represented as reflection coefficients which are transformed to log-area ratios (LARs) before transmission.

For the following operations, the speech frame is divided into 4 sub-blocks consisting each of 40 samples. Before the processing of each sub-block, the parameters of the long-term analysis filter, the LTP lag and the LTP gain, are estimated and updated in the LTP analysis block. Estimation and update is performed on the basis of the signal in the current sub-block and a stored sequence of the 120 previously reconstructed short-term residual samples.

A block of 40 long-term residual signal samples is obtained by subtracting 40 estimates of the short-term residual from the short-term residual signal itself. The resulting block is fed to the Regular Pulse Excitation (RPE) analysis which performs the basic compression function.

As a result of the RPE-analysis, the block of 40 input long-term residual samples is represented by one of 4 candidate sub-sequences of 13 pulses each. The subsequence selected is identified by the RPE grid position. The 13 RPE pulses are encoded using Adaptive Pulse Code Modulation (APCM) with estimation of the sub-block amplitude which is transmitted to the decoder as side information. The RPE parameters are also fed to a local RPE decoding and reconstruction module which produces a block of 40 samples of the quantized version of the long-term residual signal. By adding these 40 quantized samples of the long-term residual to the previously obtained block of short-term residual signal estimates, a reconstructed version of the current short-term residual signal is obtained. The block of reconstructed short-term residual signal samples is then fed to the long-term analysis filter which produces the new block of 40 short-term residual signal estimates to be used for the next sub-block thereby completing the feedback loop.

==== RPE-LTP Decoder

The simplified block diagram of the RPE-LTP decoder <<GSM-06.10>> is shown in <<rpe-decoder>>.

[[rpe-decoder]]
.Simplified block diagram of the RPE-LTP decoder
image::image9-2.png[]

The decoder includes the same structure as the feed-back loop of the encoder. In error-free transmission, the output of this stage will be the reconstructed short-term residual samples. These samples are then applied to the short-term synthesis filter followed by the de-emphasis filter resulting in the reconstructed speech signal samples.


=== Implementation

This implementation of the RPE-LTP algorithm is composed of several source files. The interface routines are in `rpeltp.c`, with prototypes in `rpeltp.h`.

Originally written to be a device driver in Unix (known as _toast_), its interface was adapted to the specifications of the ITU-T STL, and modified to operate correctly in a variety of platforms, like VAX, IBM PC compatibles, and Unix workstations (Sun and HP).

The problem of storing the state variables was solved by defining a structure containing all the necessary variables, defining a new type called `gsm`, which is a pointer to a structure. By means of this approach, several streams may be processed in parallel, provided that one structure is assigned (and that one call to the encoding/decoding routines is done) for each data stream (this can be advantageous for machines with support for parallel processing). The RPE-LTP state structure has the following fields (all except _L_z2_ and _mp_ are `short`, which are `long` and `int`, respectively):

_dp0_:: Memory of 280 past samples
_z1_:: DC-offset removal filter memory
_L_z2_:: DC-offset removal filter parameter.
_mp_:: Preemphasis
_u_:: Eighth-order short term LPC analysis coefficients
_LARpp_:: Log Area Ratio array
_j_:: Index
_nrp_:: Long-term synthesis parameter
_v_:: Ninth order short-term synthesis vector
_msr_:: Post-processing parameter
_verbose_:: Flag used only if compiled with NDEBUG==0
_fast_:: Enables fast but inaccurate computation. Does not properly process the test sequences with this mode turned on.

<<RPE-bitstream>> presents the RPE-LTP encoder output parameters in order of occurence, with parameters defined in <<GSM-06.10>>. It should be noted that the bitstream file generated by the STL implementation of the RPE-LTP algorithm uses an unpacked format, as other codecs in the STL. Therefore, each of the 76 parameters indicated in <<RPE-bitstream>> occupy an unsigned, right-adjusted 16-bit word. Unlikely to the G.711 and G.726 algorithms, however, the number of significant bits per bitstream parameter is not the same for all the parameters, as can be seen from the table. An important implication is that the STL bit error insertion routines cannot be applied directly to the bitstream generated by the STL RPE-LTP encoder. This limitation is not a function of the EID module itself, but of the serialization and parallelization (S/P) routines `serialize_*` and `parallize_*` implemented in the Utility module, which are able only to handle bitstreams that have the same number of valid bits per sample. Solution to this problem still needs to be implemented in the STL. It should be noted however that, since the full-rate GSM channel coding is not implemented in the STL, bit error insertion directly in the unprotected RPE-LTP bitstream will generally not be used. Should the user need bit error insertion in the unprotected RPE-LTP bitstream, there are two possible solutions:

* it will be necessary to pack the bits for each parameter in such a way that, as seen by the S/P routines, each sample in the packed bitstream will have a constant number of valid bits per bitstream sample. Since there are 260 (stem:[4 xx 5 xx 13]) bits for each frame, possible combinations are packed bitstreams with 65 16-bit words, of which the lower 4 bits are meaningful, or with 20 16-bit words, of which the lower 13 bits are meaningful. The former is preferred, despite the longer files generated.
* the user may modify the demonstration program to generate or accept (depending on whether it is an encoding or decoding operation) a serial bitstream format, as understood by the EID module, instead of a parallel bitstream format.

From the users' perspective, the encoding function is `rpeltp_encode`, and the decoding function is `rpeltp_decode`. Before using these functions, the state variable for either the encoder or the decoder must be initialized by `rpeltp_init`. It should be noted that encoder and decoder need individual state variables to work properly. After all the processing is performed, the memory allocated for the state variables can be freed by calling `rpeltp_delete`. The following sub-sections describe these four entry functions for the STL RPE-LTP module.

=== Portability and compliance

The portability test for these routines has been done using the test sequences designed by the GSM for the RPE-LTP (available from ETSI), which were also used to verify the compliance of the encoding and decoding function to the full-rate GSM voice codec Recommendation <<GSM-06.10>>, Annex C.

This routine has been tested in VAX/VMS with VAX-C and gcc, in the PC with Borland C v3.0 (16-bit mode) and gcc (32-bit mode). In the Unix environment in a Sun workstation with cc, acc, and gcc, and in HP with gcc. In all tested cases, 100% of the test sequences passed when the following symbols were defined at compilation time: `SASR`, `USE_FLOAT_MUL` and `NDEBUG`. The symbol _FAST_ must not be defined for perfomance compliant with the GSM 06.10 Recommendation, while `USE_FLOAT_MUL` *must* be defined at compilation time. The symbol `NeedFunctionPrototypes` must be undefined for pre-ANSI-C compilers (e.g. SunOS cc compiler).


=== Example code

==== Description of the demonstration program

One program is provided as demonstration program for the RPE-LTP module, rpedemo.c.

Program `rpedemo.c` accepts input files in either 16-bit linear PCM format, 16-bit, right-justified A-law format, or 16-bit, right-justified stem:[mu]-law format for the encoding operation. The output of the decoder can also be in any of these formats, but it will have the same format as the encoding operation if encoding and decoding is performed in a single pass (default). If the encoding and decoding operations are performed in separate steps, the format of the output signal does not need to match the format of the original linear PCM signal. The encoder output and decoder input are signals in 16-bit, right-justified samples, as described before in Sections <<sec-rpeencode>> and <<sec-rpedecode>>. Three operations are possible: encode and decode in a single pass (default), encode-only (option _-enc_), or decode-only (option _-dec_).

== RATE-CHANGE: Up- and down-sampling module

In certain applications involving digitized speech, such as subjective evaluation of speech processed by digital algorithms, it may be preferable to use sampling higher than the typical rate used for the algorithms under test. This is desirable because simpler analog filters with less phase distortion can be built. Another advantage is that upper frequency components of the signal are not lost. It also allows for the convenient shaping of the input signal, such as IRS, stem:[Delta_(SM)], and psophometric weightings. Consequently there is a need to adapt the sampling rate of the digitized signal to that of the processing algorithm. For telephony applications, the typical sampling rate is 8000 Hz with a signal bandwidth in general of 300-3400 Hz, and for wideband speech applications, a bandwidth of 50-7000 Hz is desired with sampling rate of 16000 Hz. During the 2005-2008 ITU-T study period, greater audio bandwidth were considered and superwideband and fullband audio codecs were developed. Their typical samplings rates are respectively 32000 Hz with a signal bandwidth of 50-14000 Hz, and 48000 Hz with a signal bandwidth of 20-20000 Hz. Therefore, sampling rates above 8000 Hz and 16000 Hz are desirable, respectively. In several experiments <<LDCELP-voitests>> the sampling rate was 16 kHz. In others (see <<ETSI-half>> and <<AC-05-16>>), 48 kHz and 32 kHz were utilized. Hence the need for a software tool to carry out filtering and sampling rate change. Next, the rate change and spectral weighting routines implemented in the ITU-T STL are presented.


=== Description of the Algorithm

Signal processing theory describes the basic arrangement for decimation of signals; first the signal is low-pass filtered to limit its bandwidth in order to avoid aliasing when the rate is lowered and, second, to decimate the samples, i.e., to drop out samples from the input signal, such that the desired output rate is obtained. For example, if a rate reduction from 48 kHz to 8 kHz is desired, a decimation factor of 6:1 is necessary. This is equivalent to say that, after limiting the bandwidth of the digitized speech to 4 kHz, 5 out 6 samples are skipped, or alternatively, only 1 out of 6 samples will be kept (or saved) from the signal.

The up-sampling of signals requires that each of the input samples be followed by a number of zero samples, such that the desired output rate is achieved; after this, an interpolation operation of these zero samples is performed to obtain a continuous-envelope signal. For example, up-sampling data from 8 kHz to 16 kHz requires interleaving each sample of the input signal with a zero sample followed by interpolation of the signal. This interpolation can be carried out by means of a polynomial, which is equivalent to a filtering operation.

The type of filtering required is determined by the application intended for the signals. For the tools needed in this version of the STL, three different groups of characteristics were defined:

* *High-quality*: Change in rate without changing the frequency response of the input signal. This is accomplished with a flat, linear phase, low-pass or bandpass FIR filter.
* *Spectral weighting*: Spectral weighting without rate change is necessary for some applications. For narrow-band speech, available are the IRS weighting specified in ITU-T Rec. P.48, the so-called "modified" IRS (annex D of ITU-T Rec. P.830), the far-to-near-field conversion stem:[Delta_(SM)] weighting, and the psophometric noise weighting of ITU-T Rec. O.41. For wideband signals, the mask for wideband handsets, as defined in ITU-T Rec. P.341, is also available. For super-wideband signals, the mask for super-wideband videoconferencing terminals has been derived as an extension of ITU-T Rec. P.341.
* *PCM quality*: Change in rate accompanied with modification of the frequency response of the input signal according to the mask specified in Recommendation ITU-T G.712. This is accomplished with a non-linear phase low-pass IIR filter.

==== High-quality

The response of the filters in this type of rate change must minimize phase and amplitude distortion. For example, for decimation from 48 kHz to 16 kHz, the filter must be flat up to about 8 kHz (except for the transition, or cut-off, region), with a linear phase. In other cases, it may be desirable to remove the DC component and hum noise (50--60 Hz AC line noise) from the signal without additional phase distortion to the upper region of the spectrum.

[[FIR-filter]]
.FIR filter block diagram.
image::image10-1.png[]

One way to do this is to use a linear phase finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter, as in <<FIR-filter>>. The input and output characteristic is defined by:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
y(k) = sum_(i=0)^(N-1) h(i) * x(k-i)
++++

Linear phase is guaranteed if the filter is symmetric, i.e.:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
h(k)=h(N-1-k) text(, for   ) k=0..N-1
++++

==== Narrowband weighting

===== IRS weighting

The IRS weighting corresponds to a bandpass filtering characteristic whose mask can be found in Recommendation ITU-T P.48 <<P.48>>. The send and receive spectral shapes of the IRS weighting were obtained in a round-robin series of measurements made on a number of analog telephones in the early 1970's <<BNR-ModIRS>>. From these measurements, the average send and receive frequency-response characteristics were derived. However, for the loudness balance purposes for which the IRS was designed, it was also necessary to include a 300-3400 Hz bandpass filter, known as the SRAEN _(Système de Référence pour la détermination de l'Affablissement équivalent pour la Netteté; Reference System for determining Articulation Ratings)_ filter <<P.11>>, <<G.111>>. The values of send and receive sensitivity currently given in ITU-T Rec. P.48 (columns 2 and 3 in <<tbl-IRS>>) are therefore composed of the average send and receive responses for a number of telephones, as well as the response of the SRAEN filter (see column 4 of <<tbl-IRS>>).

Because the P.48 IRS weighting used to be considered to model an average narrow-band telephone handset deployed in the PSTN, the IRS weighting has been chosen to simulate speech signals obtained from a regular handset. Examples of standardization efforts using the P.48 weighting characteristic are the Recommendations ITU-T G.711, G.721, and G.728. This weighting, as defined in P.48, is sometimes called "full-IRS" weighting.

While the weighting characteristic in P.48 was considered to model connections over analog transmission facilities in the past (although it is not clear why the SRAEN filter should be included in both the send and receive paths), it is no longer representative of connections over modern digital facilities. In particular, the low frequency roll-off gives rise to unnecessary quality degradation. For the purpose of low bit-rate coder evaluation, especially where the coder is located in the telephone handset, a better characteristic can be obtained by modifying the P.48 full-IRS response to remove the SRAEN filter as shown in columns 5 and 6 of <<tbl-IRS>>. These values are specified in Annex D of ITU-T Recommendation P.830 <<P.830>> and define the so-called "modified" IRS weighting. The modified IRS has been used in the development of Recommendations ITU-T G.723.1 and G.729.

|===

The most important part of either the full or the modified IRS weighting is the transmission (or send) characteristic. The receive characteristic is less important because listening is in general done using handsets conforming to P.48 (which eliminates the need for filtering by the software, since it is done by the telephone terminal). In addition, the receive characteristic is relatively flat. Some studies also show that the use of headphones instead of handsets does not result in significantly different results while yielding lesser listener fatigue <<HeadphoneACR>>, <<HeadphoneDCR>>. Nevertheless, for cases where the receive-side MIRS filter is to be applied, a FIR implementation of this filter is available for 8000 Hz and 16000 Hz sampling rates.

An unspecified point in both P.48 and modified IRS is the phase response of the filter. There have been discussions within UGST on this topic and the conclusion was that, since the phase response is unspecified, it should be kept as generic as possible, what is better accomplished by keeping the phase linear {blank}footnote:[In spite of that, a non-linear phase IIR IRS filter is provided in the IIR module as an example of a cascade-form IIR filter implementation.]. If a certain non-linear phase characteristic is desired by the user, this can be implemented by cascading an all-pass filter with the desired phase response with one of the available FIR IRS implementations. Therefore, the IRS filters are implemented as FIR filters, as depicted in <<FIR-filter>>.

Recommendation ITU-T P.48 presents the nominal values for the amplitude response in column 2 of its Table 1 (here reproduced in column 2 of <<tbl-IRS>>) and then the upper and lower tolerances listed in its Table 2. For the STL approach, it was decided to design IRS filters whose characteristic would deviate no more than 0.5 dB from the average values in P.48 (see in <<tx-reg-irs-frq>> the agreement of the nominal values, represented by dots, and the measured frequency response for the original P.48 IRS characteristic, represented by the continuous curve in the figure).

===== Other weighting

A filter that simulates the input response characteristic of certain mobile terminals was incorporated in the STL for data sampled at 16 kHz. <<msin-frq>> and <<msin-ir>> display the respective frequency and impulse responses for the filter.

==== Wideband weighting

===== P.341 weighting

While the IRS filter is applicable to telephony bandwidth (or narrowband) speech, for wideband speech the specification for the send and receive sides is given in Recommendation ITU-T P.341 <<P.341>>. The mask specified in P.341 is rather wide, and an implementation of the send-side mask agreed on by the experts has been incorporated in the STL.

===== Other weightings

In the process to select a wideband codec at 32 and 24 kbit/s, a 50 Hz --5 kHz bandpass filter was developed and incorporated in the STL. <<bp5k-16k-frq>> and <<bp5k-16k-ir>> display the respective frequency and impulse responses for the filter.

A 100 Hz -- 5 kHz filter was also designed for tests of another wideband codec. <<bp100_5k-16k-frq>>and <<bp100_5k-16k-ir>> show the respective frequency and impulse response of this filter.

==== Greater wideband weightings

===== P.341 extension weighting

For super-wideband signals, the mask for super-wideband videoconferencing terminals is based on the ITU-T Rec. P.341. The sensitivity/frequency characteristics of the P.341 filter were extended to a larger band [50 Hz - 14 kHz] with a sampling frequency of 32 kHz. The corresponding 50 Hz-14 kHz filter was developed and incorporated in the STL. <<fig-50_14k-32k-frq>> and <<fig-50_14k-32k-ir>> display the respective frequency and impulse responses for the filter.


===== Other weightings

To generate anchors typically used in BS.1534 <<BS.1534>> "MUlti Stimulus test with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA)" subjective tests, seven low-pass filters are also provided in the STL. Those anchors are generated by low-pass filters with cut-off frequencies 1.5, 3.5, 7, 10, 12, 14 and 20 kHz at sampling frequency of 48 kHz. Their frequency responses are shown, respectively, in <<LP1p5-frq>>, <<LP35-frq>>, <<LP7-frq>>, <<LP10-frq>>, <<LP12-frq>>, <<LP14-frq>>, and <<LP20-frq>>. Their impulse responses are also given in <<LP1p5-ir>>, <<LP35-ir>>, <<LP7-ir>>, <<LP10-ir>>, <<LP12-ir>>, <<LP14-ir>>, and <<LP20-ir>>. In addition a bandpass filter [20 Hz - 20 kHz) operating at sampling frequency of 48 kHz was also designed. Its frequency response is shown in <<bp20_20k-48k-frq>> and its impulse responses in <<bp20_20k-48k-ir>>.

==== Noise weighting

Two weighting filters are available in this version of the STL, the psophometric and the stem:[Delta_(SM)] weighting filters.

The psophometric weighting curve defined by Recommendation ITU-T O.41 is used for measuring the noise level in telephone circuits, accounting for the subjective perception of noise. The psophometric noise measure (given in dBmp) is related to the North-American C-message weighting curve (given in dBrnC), using to the following:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
dBmp = dBrnC - 90.0 dB
++++

The other type of signal weighting filter is the stem:[Delta_(SM)], used for converting acoustic signals recorded in the far field using an omnidirectional microphone to the near-field equivalent of that signal if it were in the background of a telephone user. Owing to the directionality of the human mouth, head and torso, the high frequencies will mainly be radiated in the frontal direction, while the diffuse field will represent a spatial integration of the radiation in all directions <<LTASS>>. Hence, the stem:[Delta_(SM)] filter is deployed for weighting acoustic noises (babble, vehicular, etc.) before electrical summation with clean speech files, in order to simulate speech corrupted by background noise. It is useful in subjective listening tests where precise control of the actual SNR is necessary.

Both these filters have been implemented as FIR filters. The psophometric filter has been designed for speech sampled at 8 kHz, and the stem:[Delta_(SM)] filter for speech sampled at 16 kHz. It should be noted that these filters, like the IRS filters, are also frequency-specific and, unlike the low-pass high-quality FIR filters described before, cannot be used for arbitrary rate ratio conversion.

==== PCM Quality

There are applications requiring the simulation of the response of filters found in the A/D and D/A interfaces of current transmission systems, which are in general PCM systems satisfying Recommendation ITU-T G.711. The filters associated with G.711 are specified in Recommendation ITU-T G.712 <<G.712>>. The main characteristic of these filters is the low out-of-band rejection of 25 dB.

In this context it is also necessary to simulate the convertion back to and forth the analog domain, e.g. to simulate multiple transcodings which are called _asynchronous trancodings_ {blank}footnote:[As the name indicates, there is no synchronization between sampling instants of the two digital systems, i.e., re-sampling in the succeeding A/D is not synchronous to the clock in the preceding D/A converter.]. One way to simulate asynchronous transcodings is by means of a non-linear phase filter (non-constant group delay), which is most efficiently implemented using IIR filters.

Infinite impulse response (IIR) filters used in this tool are of the parallel form (see <<IIR-filter>>), described by the equation:

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
    H_I^p(z) = K + \sum_{l=1}^{L}
                    { b_{0l}+b_{1l} z^{-1} \over
                      \ 1+c_{1l} z^{-1}+ c_{2l} z^{-2} \
                    }
++++

and of the cascade form (see <<IIR-cascade-filter>>), described
by the equation:

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
    H_I^c(z) = \prod_{l=1}^{N}
                    { b_{0l} + b_{1l} z^{-1} + b_{2l} z^{-2}\over
                           1 + c_{1l} z^{-1} + c_{2l} z^{-2}
                    }
++++

=== Implementation

The rate change algorithm is organized in two modules, FIR and IIR, with prototypes respectively in `firflt.h` and `iirflt.h`. It evolved from a version initially developed as part of the ETSI Half-rate GSM codec Host Laboratory exercise <<SCD-ETSI>>. The rate-change functionality was incorporated in the STL92 in two main files, `hqflt.c` and `pcmflt.c`. To make these routines more flexible, the following modifications were included:

FIR:: the FIR module was divided into a library source file (`fir-lib.c`) containing the basic filtering and initialization functions, as well as into source files for each kind of filter: `fir-flat.c` for high-quality low-pass and bandpass filters, `fir-irs.c` for the classical and modified IRS filters, and so on;
IIR:: the IIR module was divided into a library file (`iir-lib.c`) containing basic filtering and initialization functions, as well as into source files for each kind of filter: `iir-g712.c` for G.712 filtering using the parallel-form filters, `iir-flat.c` for flat bandpass 1:3 and 3:1 asynchronization filtering using a cascade-form filter, and so on.

Files `fir-\*.c` of the FIR module contain all the routines implementing FIR filters, i.e., the high-quality filters and IRS, stem:[Delta_(SM)] and psophometric weighing filters. Files `iir-*.c` of the IIR module implement the IIR filters, i.e., the parallel-form PCM filter and the cascade-form 3:1 asynchronization filter.

Some of these filters have been implemented using 24-bit coefficients, thus allowing real-time, bit-exact hardware implementation of these routines. It may be noted that, for these filters in the STL, the calculations are performed in floating-point arithmetics by converting the coefficients from the range stem:[-2^(23)]..stem:[2^(23)]--1 to stem:[-1 .. +1], which is not needed in real time hardware with fixed-point DSPs.

Frequency response and impulse response plots are provided for the STL filters in the forthcoming sections. It should be noted, however, that the impulse responses shown have been computed from the 16-bit quantized impulse responses of the filters, as generated by the demonstration programs, while the frequency responses were calculated as described in section <<RATE-Tests>>. It should be noted that the apparent asymmetry in some impulse responses happens because an integer number of samples are generated, and linear interpolation is used to draw the figure. If the impulse responses were derived directly from the filter coefficients, the plot would be symmetric.


NOTE: When the same filter type is used by several independent speech materials (e.g. several speech files) within the same execution of an application program, the user must remember that the filters have memory. Hence, wrong results can be obtained if a given number of initial samples are not discarded. See section <<Rate-exp>> for an example, where the first 512 samples are skipped when calculating the power level of the output tone.


==== FIR module

The frequency responses of the implemented high-quality low-pass filters are shown in <<hq-frq-1-2>> and <<hq-frq-1-3>> (for rate-change factors 2 and 3, respectively), while the telephone bandwidth bandpass filter is given in <<hq-bandpass>> (only a rate-change factor of 2 is available). The impulse responses of these filters are given in <<ir-hq-up>>, <<ir-hq-down>>, and <<ir-bandpass>>, respectively for the up-sampling filters (factors 2 and 3), for the down-sampling filters (factors 2 and 3), and for the bandpass filter.

The transmit-side IRS filter has been implemented for the "regular" and modified flavors. The regular transmit-side P.48 IRS filter amplitude responses are shown in <<tx-reg-irs-frq>> (the available sampling rates are 8 and 16 kHz). The transmit-side modified IRS filter is available for sampling at 16 kHz and 48 kHz, and their frequency responses are shown in <<tx-mod-irs-frq>>. The impulse response of these transmit-side IRS filters are in figures <<tx-reg-irs-ir>> and <<tx-mod-irs-ir>> for the regular and modified IRS filters, respectively. The receive-side modified IRS filter has also been implemented and the frequency responses for 8 kHz and 16 kHz sampling rate are found in <<rx-mod-irs-frq>>. The impulse responses of the receive-side modified IRS filters are shown in <<rx-mod-irs-ir>>.

The frequency response of the STL psophometric filter is given in <<pso-08k-frq>>, and that of the stem:[Delta_(SM)] filter in <<delta-sm-frq>>.

For wideband signals, three weighting filters are available. The transmit-side ITU-T P.341 filter amplitude response is shown in <<tx-p341-frq>>, and its impulse response is shown in <<tx-p341-ir>>. Alternatively to the P.341 filter, the frequency and impulse responses of the two bandpass filters, 50 Hz-5 kHz bandpass filter and 100 Hz -5 kHz, are shown, respectively, in <<bp5k-16k-frq>> and <<bp5k-16k-ir>>, and in <<bp100_5k-16k-frq>> and <<bp100_5k-16k-ir>>.

For super wideband signals, four weighting filters are available. The 50 Hz-14 kHz bandpass filter, extension of ITU-T P.341 filter, is presented in <<fig-50_14k-32k-frq>> (frequency response), and <<fig-50_14k-32k-ir>> (impulse response). Alternatively to this P.341 filter extension, the frequency responses of the three MUSHRA anchors filters, LP3.5, LP7 and LP10 filters, are shown <<LP35-frq>>, <<LP7-frq>> and <<LP10-frq>>, respectively. Their impulse responses are shown in <<LP35-ir>>, <<LP7-ir>> and <<LP10-ir>>, respectively.

The high-quality filters were implemented for rate-change factors of 2 and 3. The IRS filters, band-limiting filters and MUSHRA anchors have been designed for specific _sampling rates_ (e.g. 8 and 48 kHz). It should be noted that, while the high-quality filters are independent of the rate, these filters are not, because their masks are specified in terms of Hz, rather than normalized frequencies. This means that to carry out a high-quality up-sampling from 8 to 16 kHz, and from 16 to 32 kHz, the same routines are called, while for IRS, band-limiting or MUSHRA anchors, there is no rate-change routine from 16 to 32 kHz.

Since the digital filters have memory, state variables are needed. In this version of the STL, a type `SCD_FIR` is defined, containing the past sample memory, as well as filter coefficients and other control variables. Its fields, whose values shall never be changed by the user, are as follows:

_lenh0_:: Number of FIR coefficients
_dwn_up_:: Down-sampling factor
_k0_:: Start index in next segment (needed in segment-wise filtering)
_h0_:: Pointer to array with FIR coefficients
_T_:: Pointer to delay line
_hswitch_:: Switch to FIR-kernel: up- or down-sampling

The relevant routines for each module are described in the next sections. footnote:[It should be noted that in the source code files there are local (privately-defined) functions which are not intended to be directly accessed by the user and therefore are not described here.]

*Prototype:* `firflt.h`

*Source code:* `fir-lib.c`

*Description:*

This is the main entry routine for generic FIR filtering. It works as a switch to specific up- and down-sampling FIR-kernel functions. The adequate lower-lever filtering routine private to the filtering module (which is not visible by the user) is defined by the initialization routines. Currently, this function does not work properly for sample-by-sample downsampling operation, i.e. when stem:[lseg=1]. This limitation should be corrected in a future version.

Please note that prior to the first call to `hq_kernel`, one of the initialization routines `hq_*_init` must be called to allocate memory for state variables and the set the desired filter coefficients.

After returning from this function, the state variables are saved to allow segment-wise filtering through successive calls of `hq_kernel`. This is useful when large files have to be processed.

*Variables:*

_lseg_:: Number of input samples. Should be larger than 1 for proper downsampling operation.

_x_ptr_:: Array with input samples.

_fir_ptr_:: Pointer to FIR-struct.

_y_ptr_:: Pointer to output samples.

==== IIR Module

The IIR module contains filters whose main use is for asynchronous filtering. For telephony bandwidth asynchronous filtering, PCM filters are available in both cascade and parallel IIR filter forms. For wideband speech (50--7000 Hz), 3:1 and 1:3 rate-change factor filters are available. A transmit-side IRS filter for speech sampled at 8 kHz is also available in this module as an example of implementation of an IIR cascade-form filter.

The PCM filters have been designed for _sampling rates_ of 8 and 16 kHz. It should be noted that the G.712 mask is specified in terms of Hz, rather than normalized frequencies. Therefore this applies only to rate conversions of factor 2, i.e., 8 kHz to 16 kHz and 16 kHz to 8 kHz. The frequency responses of the implemented PCM filters are shown in <<pcm-frq>>.

Since the digital filters need memory, state variables are needed. In the STL, a type `SCD_IIR` has been defined for parallel-form IIR filters, containing the past memory samples as well as filter coefficients and other control variables. Its fields are as follows:

_nblocks_:: Number of coefficient sets
_idown_:: Up-/down-sampling factor
_k0_:: Start index in next segment
_gain_:: Gain factor
_direct_cof_:: Direct path coefficient
_b[3]_:: Pointer to numerator coefficients
_c[2]_:: Pointer to denominator coefficients
_T[2]_:: Pointer to state variables
_hswitch_:: Switch to IIR-kernel: Up or down-sampling

For the cascade-form IIR filters, the state variable structure defined is `CASCADE_IIR` which is slightly different from the one for the parallel form structure:

_nblocks_:: Number of stages in cascade
_idown_:: Up-/down-sampling factor
_k0_:: Start index in next segment
_gain_:: Gain Factor
_a[2]_:: Pointer to numerator coefficients
_b[2]_:: Pointer to denominator coefficients
_T[4]_:: Pointer to state variables
_hswitch_:: Switch to IIR-kernel: Up or down-sampling

It should be noted that the values of the fields must not be altered, and for most purposes they are not needed by the user. The relevant routines for each module are described in the next sections.

[[RATE-Tests]]
=== Tests and portability

Compliance with the R&Os was verified by checking the frequency response of the filters and the size of the output files. Frequency response was obtained by feeding the filtering routines with sinewaves and calculating the ratio in dB, for each frequency of interest.

Portability of this module was checked by running the same speech file on a proven platform and on a test platform. Comparison of both processed files should show either no differences or yield equivalent results. footnote:[Some differences may appear in the output files, but for a few samples and by no more than 1 LSB. As an example, in the tests for checking VAX and SUN-OS, one of the files differed in 3 samples out of 49152 for a cascade of high-quality up- and down-sampling of 1:6 and 6:1. For small rate change factors, differences are unlikely.] Tests were performed in the VAX/VMS environment with VAX-C and gcc, in MSDOS with Borland Turbo C++ Version 1.00 and gcc (DJGPP), in SunOS with cc, acc, and gcc, and in HPUX with gcc.

[[Rate-exp]]
=== Examples

==== Description of the demonstration programs

Three programs are provided as demonstration programs for the RATE module, `firdemo.c`, `iirdemo.c`, and filter.c.

Programs `firdemo.c` and `iirdemo.c` were the first demonstration programs for the rate change module. The former is found in directory `fir` of the STL and contains a cascade processing of the FIR filters available upto the STL96. The latter is found in directory `iir` of the STL and contains a cascade processing of the IIR filters available up to the STL96. However, because of the increasing static memory requirement for cascade processing that came with the introduction of new filters in the STL, these two programs became prohibitive and their maintenance was discontinued. They are still functional, although outdated.

Program `filter.c` is a single demonstration program that incorporates both IIR and FIR filters in the STL and has been kept up-to-date as new filters are added to the STL. Compared to the `firdemo.c` and `iirdemo.c` programs, `filter.c` can only perform one filtering operation per pass, while `firdemo.c` and `iirdemo.c` could perform a number of 1:1 operations combined with two up-sampling and two downsampling operations. Hence, several calls of the filter program are necessary to implement what was accomplished by a single call of `firdemo.c` and `iirdemo.c`, in addition to the cumulative quantization noise (from the successive float-to-short conversions). In applications where multiple filtering is needed and the user is concerned with the quantization noise accumulation, a custom-made program could be used e.g. based on a specialization of either `firdemo.c`, `iirdemo.c`, or filter.c.

==== Example: Calculating frequency responses

The following C code exemplifies the use of some of the filter
functions available in the STL. The C code generates a number of tones
which are specified by the user (lower, upper, and step frequencies).
The frequency response is obtained by calculating the power change for
each single frequency before and after filtered by the selected
filter.

== EID: Error Insertion Device

An error insertion device (EID) is used to study the behaviour of codec over digital transmission systems and equipments under error conditions. This requires a model for the transmission channel, and an error generation algorithm. In the most general case, burst or random bit error generators are needed. In other cases, such as when evaluating mobile and wireless systems, random and bursty frame erasures are of importance.

The EID module implements the four functionalities: random and bursty bit errors, and random and bursty frame erasures. These four models are based on a linear congruential sequence random number generator, and the bit error insertion and random frame erasure are based on a two-state channel model.

The burst frame erasure function requires a more elaborated model. For the specific application of wireless systems, a model based on Markov sequences is used. This is known within ITU as the Bellcore model <<Bellcore-Model-1>>, <<Bellcore-Model-2>>. This model was first used in the standardization of ITU-T G.729, and has been incorporated in the STL since.

Upon development needs of scalable and embedded-variable bitrate codecs, a more elaborate EID simulation software was added in STL2009 release. This tools allows more complex error insertion simulations: layered application mode where upper layers are dependent on the error of lower layers, and (optional) individual application mode where errors are inserted separately to each layer.

=== Description of Algorithm

==== Simple Channel Model

The bit error insertion algorithm of the EID is based on a channel model where (binary) data bitstreams are to be transmitted, and is based on the discrete _Gilbert Elliott channel_ (GEC) model, described in <<GEC>>.

This model (see <<fig-GEC>>) has two states, Good (stem:[G]) and Bad or Burst (stem:[B]). Associated with these two states, there are four parameters (probabilities): two relating to the probability of remaining in state stem:[G] or stem:[B], and two relating to the probability of transition from the current state to the other state (i.e., the occurrence of a binary digit transition, or error).

The probabilities associated with the channel states are stem:[P] and stem:[Q], stem:[P] being the probability of transition from state stem:[G] to stem:[B], and stem:[Q] the probability of transition from stem:[B] to stem:[G]. Hence, the probability of remaining in the same state is stem:[(1-P)] and stem:[(1-Q)] for states stem:[G] and stem:[B], respectively. For a given state, there are probabilities that a change in a bit occur, and this is stem:[P_G] for state stem:[G], and stem:[P_B] for state stem:[B].

Therefore, the channel may be either in the good state stem:[G], where the mean bit error probability stem:[P_G] is very low (stem:[P_G ~~ 0]), or in the bad state stem:[B], where the mean bit error probability stem:[P_B] is rather high (stem:[P_B ~~ 0.5]).

[[fig-GEC]]
.Gilbert Elliot Channel Model (GEC)
image::image11-1.png[]

The mean bit error probability _BER_ generated by this channel model is

[[EQ1]]
[stem]
++++
BER = P/(1-gamma) * P_B + Q/(1-gamma) * P_G
++++

where

[[EQ2]]
[stem]
++++
gamma = 1-(P+Q)
++++

is a measure for the correlation of the bit errors, and consequently an indication of the burst or random characteristic of the channel. In this issue, stem:[gamma ~~ 0] implies a nearly random error channel, while stem:[gamma ~~ 1] implies a totally bursty channel. Please note that _BER_ is reasonable only in the range stem:[0 <= BER <= 0.5].

For many applications, bit error sequences with a distinct mean bit error probability _BER_ and a distinct bit error correlation stem:[gamma] are of interest. From (<<EQ1>>) and (<<EQ2>>) we get for the remaining parameters of the stem:[GEC] for arbitrarily chosen values of stem:[0 <= P_G < P_B <= 0.5]:

[[EQ3]]
[stem]
++++
P = (1-gamma) * (1- (P_B-BER)/(P_B-P_G))
++++

[[EQ4]]
[stem]
++++
Q = (1-gamma) * (P_B-BER)/(P_B-P_G)
++++

In the Error Insertion Device (EID) the special values stem:[P_G=0] and stem:[P_B=0.5] are chosen. This relates to the fact that in the good state no bit changes are expected, hence stem:[P_G=0]; now, for the bad state, the channel is supposed to be in a totally uncertain state, then stem:[P_B=0.5]. With this choice, (<<EQ3>>) and (<<EQ4>>) reduce to:

[[EQ5]]
[stem]
++++
P = 2 * (1-gamma) * BER
++++

[[EQ6]]
[stem]
++++
Q = (1-gamma) * (1-2 * BER)
++++

As an example, <<Gamma>> shows the effect of stem:[gamma] on the auto-correlation of a bitstream, generated by the stem:[GEC] (with stem:[BER = 0.02] in (<<EQ5>>),(<<EQ6>>)).

[[Gamma]]
.Bit Error Correlation for a Bit Error Rate of 2%
image::image11-2.png[]

It can be seen that for stem:[gamma=0] the bit errors are statistically independent, because the autocorrelation sequence ACF stem:[(kappa)] has a peak (1.0) in stem:[kappa=0], and the remaining coefficients ACF(1),ACF(2),... oscillate around the selected bit error rate of 0.02 (stem:[2 * 10^(-2)]). For stem:[gamma=0.5], slightly bursty errors can be observed, when the initial terms of the correlation sequence build a transition region, and the remaining (higher) terms are around 0.02. Increasing stem:[gamma] towards unity, the correlation between the bit errors also increases, leading to totally bursty errors in the limit.

==== Bellcore Model

The following description has been based on <<Bellcore-Model-1>>. The actual error sequence in a wireless environment will depend upon the carrier frequency, user speed, detection scheme, type of diversity employed, mean SNR, hand-off mechanism, etc. Though a model could be created using the above parameters, it would be impossible to apply because of the wide variance of the model parameters. It was found that a speech coder can be tested using error bursts generated by a much simpler model because the burst error performance of a speech coder can be characterized to a great extend by the way it reacts to short (5--20 ms), medium (30--60 ms) and long (over 80 ms) error bursts. If a coder performs well in the presence of a representative range of short, medium and long error bursts, it can be expected that the coder will behave well in an actual wireless communications environment, even though the actual radio channel generates error bursts with different statistics.

The Bellcore model, rather than modeling the wireless communications channel, models the occurrence of these short, medium, and long error bursts that would enable the characterization of the coder reaction to error bursts and to the error burst patterns it is expected it will encounter in practice.

[[N-state-Markov]]
.N-state Markov Model
image::image11-3.png[]

An N-state Markov model, as illustrated in <<N-state-Markov>>, is used in the STL to generate frame erasure bursts. This model has to be adequate to test speech coders using short speech segments (6-8s). In this model, a transition from any state (0..N--1) to state 0 represents a frame received without errors, while a transition from state j--1 to state j indicates that j previous frames have been received in error. A transition from j back to 0 marks the end of an error burst of length j followed by a good frame.

The Markov model with N states for creating a bursty wireless communications channel is capable of erasing up to N--1 frames. The model generates both frames with correlated frame erasures and error-free frames. The value of N will depend on the frame duration of the speech coder under test and the maximum error burst length the coder expects to find in practice. The error statistics can be controlled by selecting the N--1 transition probabilities stem:[p_k], stem:[k]=0..N--2. The probabilities will also determine the sequence of good and erased frames.

The steady state probabilities can be calculated by solving the state transition matrix or using numerical methods. If stem:[S_j] denotes the steady state probability that the chain is in state stem:[j] and stem:[p_j] is the probability of transitioning from state stem:[j] to stem:[j+1], the following relationships can be established:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
S_(j+1) = p_j S_j,  0 <= j <= N-2
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
S_0 = sum_(j=0)^(N-1) S_j (1-p_j), (p_(N-1)=0)
++++

The equations above can be solved since the probabilities should satisfy:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
sum_(j=0)^(N-1) p_j = 1
++++

A frame erasure length of stem:[j] can occur only if the chain first enters state stem:[j], and then transitions to state 0. The probability stem:[P_(fe)] of this occur is

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
P_(fe) = S_j (1-p_j)
++++

The probability of receiving a frame in error can be calculated as

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
P_e = sum_(j=1)^(N-1) j P_(fe)(j)
++++

and the probability of receiving an error-free frame is stem:[1-P_e]. It can be seen that the steady state probability of being in state 0, stem:[S_0], also gives the probability of receiving a frame without error, i.e.,

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
S_0 = 1 - sum_(j=1)^(N-1) j P_(fe)(j)
++++

The frame error distribution can be controlled by selecting the transition probabilities.

==== Error insertion for layered bitstreams

A layered scalable codec provides a multi-layer bitstream that can be modified by application or network entities:

* The core layer of the codec provides a minimum quality.
* Upper layers enable improving quality by increasing bitrate up to a maximum value.

One main feature of a scalable codec lies in the layering flexibility. The layers can be transported over different channels or over the same channel but with different priorities. Further the bitrate can be adjusted between minimal and maximal values by any network element in the communication chain.

To simulate the layering functionality a bitstream error application tool (eid-ev) was added for STL2009 release. This tool applies layer errors at desired levels. For each frame of an input bitstream, this tool performs the following operations:

[class=steps]
. Read and validate the input frame, (each input frame size needs to represent a valid layer boundary)
. Read the frame error pattern files, (one error pattern file is read for each layer)
. Apply errors by copying non-distorted layers to the output frame, and setting the bits of distorted layers to the softbit value zero.
. Truncate output frame if consecutive higher layers are hit by errors.
. Set the correct synchronization header of the output frame
. Set the correct length of the output frame.
. Provide statistics of error application across layers.

=== Implementation

The EID algorithm is written in C-source code can be found in the module `eid.c`, with prototypes in `eid.h`. This version evolved from previous C implementations developed by PKI {blank}footnote:[Phillips Communications Industry.], and was used in the Host Laboratory Sessions of ETSI's contest for the second generation of the GSM Digital Mobile Radio Systems, and in the Selection Phase of the ITU-T 8 kbit/s speech coder.

The random-number generator is based on a linear congruential technique, as described in <<Knuth>>. The rule here is:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
a_n = (69069 ** a_(n-1) +1 ) text(mod) 2^(32)","
++++

which is converted (mapped) to a float number between 0 and 1.

Since the random number generator and the channel need their internal state to be saved, two state variable data structure types were defined for the EID module. The structure type called `SCD_EID` is applicable to the burst and random bit erasure functions, as well as to the random frame erasure function. The fields of this structure are:

_seed_:: Seed for random number generator.
_nstates_:: Number of states of the channel model (presently 2).
_current_state_:: Index of current channel state.
_BER_:: Pointer to array containing thresholds according to the bit error rate in each state.
_usrber_:: User defined bit error rate.
_usrgamma_:: User defined correlation factor.
_matrix_:: Pointer to matrix containing thresholds according to the probabilities for changing from one state to another one.

For burst frame erasures only, a different state variable structure type called `BURST_EID` has been defined, whose fields are:

_seedptr_:: Memory for random number generator.
_internal_:: Array with probabilities for each state of the Markov process.
_index_:: Channel's current state.

The values of the fields shall not be altered and are not needed by user.

The random number generator always starts from the same point, if the user does not specify different initial seeds. In order to avoid this, the EID state variables should be saved at the end of the processing of a speech sequence, e.g. to a file by the user. This saving is not implemented by the EID module because this involves I/O to the computer file systems, and this would violate one of the UGST guidelines. Nevertheless, an example of this procedure is described in the demonstration programs that accompany this release of the EID. Therefore, users should keep in mind that, unless they save (e.g. to a file) the EID state at the end of the processing, identical error patterns will be produced, when the processing is re-started.

The EID routines for random bit errors are `BER_generator` and `BER_insertion`; for random frame erasures, `FER_generator_random` and `FER_module`; for burst frame erasures `FER_generator_burst`; and `open_eid`, `open_burst_eid` and `close_eid` for initialization (allocation) and release of EID state structures `SCD_EID` and `BURST_EID`. Their description can be found next. Besides these, there are other routines which are local (private) to the EID module, and therefore are not described.

[[sec-g192bitstream]]
==== Bitstream format

The EID module operates on _softbits_ basis. Softbits are defined as a multi-level representation of the binary ("hard") bits '1' and '0' which are associated to probabilities of being in error. The softbit definition adopted in the ITU-T STL uses 16-bit words as representation of the hardbits `'1'` and `'0'`, where a hardbit `'1'` is represented by the softbit `0x0081` and a hardbit `'0'` is represented by the softbit `0x007F`. This means that 8 significant bits in a softbit is available for other utilities. When soft-decision is not used, the hard bit information can be derived directly from Bit 7 of the 16-bit softbit word. It should also be noted that values `0x0081` and `0x007f` are equally spaced from `0x0000` (in other words, `0x0000` is exactly the middle of the two-complement range for `0x81` and `0x7F`), such that a softbit representation `0x0000` represents _total uncertainty_ of the true bit value.

Error patterns produced and used by the EID module use this softbit definition. Input and output data (i.e. signals which are affected by bit errors or frame erasures) also use softbits, but additionally have a so-called synchronization header.

The _synchronization header_ is defined as two consecutive 16-bit words, the first one always being a synchronization (sync) word in the range `0x6B21` to `0x6B2F`, followed by the bitstream length word, a two-complement number indicating the number of softbits in the frame. The sync word `0x6B20` is reserved to indicate that a frame erasure happened. For example, for the RPE-LTP algorithm, which uses 260 bits per frame, the soft bitstream would have the format indicated in <<fig-bs-rpeltp>>. It can be seen that each RPE-LTP frame will have 262 16-bit words, being one for the sync word (`0x6B21`) in the example), one for the frame length word (whose value here is 260), followed by 260 softbit words (here corresponding to `'1'`, `'0'`, ..., `'0'`, `'0'`). This combination of the synchronization header and a softbit "payload" is called the bitstream signal representation and is used in ITU-T Recommendation G.192 <<G.192>> to represent encoded signals between speech encoders, error-insertion devices, transmission channel models and speech decoders.

The following summarizes the bit error insertion rules:

For input `'1'` (`0x0081`):

.. if the error pattern is in the range `0x00FF..0x0081` (255..129), then the output will be `0x0001..0x007F` (1..127), respectively;

                   _*ybuff_);
----

*Prototype:* `eid.h`

*Description:*

Implementation of the frame erasure function based on the GEC model allowing a variable degree of burstiness (as specified by parameter `gamma` in the state variable structure of type `SCD_EID` pointed by _EID_). This function actually erases the current frame (as described below), as opposed to function `FER_generator_random()`, which only indicates whether the current frame should be erased.

* computes the "frame erasure pattern";
* erases all bits in one frame according the current state of the pattern generator.

The input (undisturbed) and output (disturbed) buffers have samples conforming to the bitstream representation description in Annex B of G.192. The input and output bitstream are compliant to the bitstream format described before, i.e. are comprised of a synchronization header (sync word followed by a frame length word) and softbits representing the encoded bitstream. The sync and frame length words are always located in the offsets 0 and 1 of the array, respectively. Should the frame be erased (depending on the frame erasure pattern), all softbits are set to `0x0000`, which corresponds to a total uncertainty about the true bit values.

In addition, the lower 4 bits of the sync word in the synchronization header are set to 0. This makes it easier for the succeeding software to detect an erased frame. The frame length word is copied unmodified to the output buffer.

*Variables:*

=== Tests and portability

Portability may be checked by running the same speech file on a proven platform and on a test platform, for the whole range of input parameters. Results should be identical when the compilation is done with the symbol `PORT_TEST` properly defined and the channel states are set to a same value.

For the eid-ev program, please note that the 16 bit oriented G.192 files require correct byte swapping of inputs and outputs on big/little-endian machines. It checks for inconsistent sync headers and exits the program with a warning if incorrectly swapped synchronism headers are detected.

The original EID routines had portability tested for VAX/VMS with VAX-C, MS-DOS with Turbo C v2.0, Sun-OS with Sun-C, and HPUX with gcc. The newly introduced eid-ev programs were tested for Microsoft C-compiler and gcc on Cygwin.

=== Examples

==== Description of demonstration programs

Number of programs are provided as demonstration programs for the EID module, `eiddemo.c` (version 3.2), `eid8k.c` (version 3.2), `eid-xor.c` (version 1.0), `gen-patt.c` (version 1.4), `ep-stats.c` (version 2.0), `eid-int.c` (version 1.0), `eid-ev.c` (version 1.0), `gen_rate_profile.c` (version 1.2).

Program `eiddemo.c` uses input and output file in the form of a serial bit stream conforming to the bitstream signal representation, as defined in Annex B of ITU-T G.192. This program will disturb the input bitstream with errors using the Gilbert Elliot Channel model for random or burst bit error insertion and for random frame erasures. The Bellcore model, which is used for burst frame erasures, is supported as a command line option, but not as default. It should be noted that this program uses function `FER_module()`, not function `FER_generator_random()`, for random frame erasures.

Program `eid8k.c` was developed during the standardization process of the ITU-T G.729 8 kbit/s speech codec for the task of producing bit error masks which would be used in the host laboratory hardware-implemented EID. For this program, input files are not generated, but only bit error pattern files. Consistent with the definition in the STL, error patterns do not have synchronization headers (sync word and frame length word), but only softbits representing disturbance of the channel. GEC and the Bellcore model are supported in this program. The output file format is, as was necessary for the G.729 work, different from a serial bitstream as defined in the STL because the softbits are saved as `char` (8-bit words) rather than as `short` (16-bit words). Conversion of this format to the STL 16-bit bitstream format can be accomplished using the unsupported program `ch2sh.c`.

It should be noted that both programs save in files the current state of the EID models under use and also try to read these state files at startup time (if not found, the programs create new ones, which are updated when the programs terminate).

Program `eid-xor.c` is an error-insertion program that simply XORs bits in a bitstream file (in one out of three formats: G.192, byte-oriented G.192, and compact) with error patterns (bit errors or frame erasures in one out of three formats) and saves the disturbed bitstream in a file. The error patterns need not have been produced by any of the EID models implemented in the STL, they only have to be in one of the three input formats. Since error patterns are either bit error EPs or frame erasure EPs, simultaneous bit errors and frame erasures are not allowed by `eid-xor.c`.

The program `gen-patt.c` is used to generate error patterns (EPs) using the EID models implemented in the STL (Gilbert and Bellcore models). The EPs will be either frame erasures or bit errors EPs, since the models in the STL do not support mixed frame erasure/bit error mode.

Program `ep-stats.c` examines an error pattern file (either bit error EPs or frame erasure EPs) and displays the actual BER/FER found in the EP and the distribution of number of consecutive errored bits or erased frames.

Program `eid-int.c` interpolates a frame erasure EP such that each synchronism word found in the EP is repeated a user-specified number of times. This is useful to align the frame erasures for codecs that have frame sizes that are an integer sub-multiple of each other (e.g. 10ms codecs and 20 ms codecs). In the latter example, the master EP will be the 20ms one, and the one generated by eid-int would be used for the 10ms codec.

Program `eid-ev.c` performs an error insertion for layered G.192 files. This program can be used to apply errors to individual layers in layered bitstreams such as G.729.1 or G.718.

Program `gen_rate_profile.c` generates random rate/layer switching file.

As a final note, it should be reinforced that the definition of the symbol `PORT_TEST` at compilation time *will* affect the operation of the programs as explained before. If this symbol is defined, functions `open_eid()` and `open_burst_eid()` will always start from the same seed. Therefore, the output of the programs will be the same, unless EID state files are available. When that symbol is not defined at compilation time, the programs will use the run-time library function `time()` to get the seed used in functions `open_eid()` and `open_burst_eid()`.

==== Using layered bitstream error routine (eid-ev)

The demonstration program, `eid-ev.c` demonstrates the use of this module to apply errors in a scalable layered bit stream to simulate a flexible transport channel.

G.192 bitstreams (with sync header), G.192 byte-oriented bitstreams (with sync header) can be processed with this tool. (The byte oriented G.192 input stream is however limited to a maximum frame size of 255). The supported frame error patterns formats for the layers are the G.192 16-bit softbit format (without synchronism header) and the byte-oriented version of the G.192 format (also without synchronism header).

After processing the `eid-ev` program supplies statistics for the layer erasing operations performed for each layer. The statistics reported are the errors applied in the `eid-ev` error application ('erasing rate') as well as the total erasure rate ('total erasure rate'). The total erasure rate includes both input erasures and erasures performed in the `eid-ev` layer error application. When calculating the `eid-ev` 'erasing rate', applying an layer error to an already erased input layers is not counted as an layer erasure. The statistics can be suppressed by using the -q (quiet option).

To enable the simulation of cascaded network elements, the output of one eid-ev operation can be used as input to a subsequent eid-ev operation.

===== Error Application Modes

By default the tool operates in the layered error application mode, in this case errors that hit one layer will also lead to the erasure of higher layers. Optionally, the tool can operate individual error application mode, for this case it is assumed that layers are transported over individual uncorrelated channels. Thus for the individual error application mode an error in one layer does not result in an error in any other layer.

The layered error application mode is simulated by simply truncating the frame according to the error in the lowest layer for that frame. If the core (lowest layer) is hit by a layer error the frame is marked as a G192_FER frame, otherwise it is marked as a valid G192_SYNC frame with a shortened frame length.

The individual error application mode is simulated by setting the softbits for the individual layers with errors to the value zero. Subsequently the frame is then truncated if the highest layers have consecutive layer errors. If the frame has remaining layer errors (layers with all zero softbits) after attempting truncation, the frame is tagged as a G192_FER frame. If the frame has no remaining layer errors after truncation it is re-tagged as a valid G192_SYNC frame.

Note that a scalable decoder that wants to utilize the valid bits that may remain in the layers of bitstream after the individual error application operation will need to scan G192_FER tagged frames with a non-zero frame length for the layers with valid bits by discarding the layers with all zero bits.

===== Program options for EID-EV

Usage:

[%unnumbered]
[source,sh]
----
eid-ev [options] in_bs e0 [e1, ..., eN] out_bs
----

Where:

`in_bs`:: input encoded speech bitstream file
`eX`:: error pattern bitstream file (one for each layer)
`out_bs`:: disturbed encoded speech bitstream file

options:

`-bs mode`:: Mode for bitstream (g192 or byte)
`-ep mode`:: Mode for error pattern file (g192 or byte)
`-ind`:: Individual layer error application (individual intermediate layers may be erased)
`-layers`:: Set layering setup in absolute bits default is "-layers 160,240,320,480,640"
`-q`:: Quiet operation, skip statistics
`-h`:: Displays this message
`-help`:: Displays a complete instructive help message

===== Examples

For example, one frame of the input bitstream will comprise 640 bits for a 32 kbit/s codec operating a frame size of 20 ms, the core rate is 24 kbit/s (480 bits) and the higher layer is 8 kbit/s (160 bits). To apply correlated layered errors to the two layers of the bitstream the following command line may be issued:

[align=center]
`eid-ev -layers 480,640 inp f.01.g192 f.30.g192 outp.lay`

where `f.01.g192` and `f.30.g192` are frame error pattern files with 1 % FER and 30 % FER respectively. And where the `inp` is a valid G192 bitstream file (containing frame sizes 0, 480, 640 only) and `outp.lay` is the resulting G192 bitstream file. If individual layer error application is desired the following command may be issued.

[align=center]
`eid-ev -ind -layers 480,640 inp fer.01.g192 fer.30.g192 outp.ind`

where `outp.ind` is the resulting G192 bitstream file after individual layer error application.

===== Default layering

Consider a 20-ms frame example given in <<fig-ExampleG192InputFrame>>. Here, the default layering is "-layers 160,240,320,480,640", which corresponds to the accumulated layer bitrates of 8, 12, 16, 24 and 32 kbit/s. This default layering requires five error pattern files, e.g.

[align=center]
`eid-ev inp f.00.g192 f.02.g192 f.06.g192 f.10.g192 f.20.g192 outp`

Note that a 0 kbit/s input frames are allowed, there are two possible 0-kbit/s frames:

* NoData frame (zero length and a G192_SYNC tag) (see <<fig-ExampleG192NoDataFrame>>).
* A totally erased frame (zero length and a G192_FER tag), (see <<fig-G192outputFrameLayer034Error>>).

===== EID-EV G.192 Output frame examples

<<fig-G192outputFrameLayer3Error>> gives an output frame example where layer 3 is hit by a layer error in the layered application mode. Since layer 3 is a lower layer to layer 4 and 5, those two layers are also truncated from the frame data. In <<fig-G192outputFrameLayer134Error>>, the layer 1, 3 and 4 are hit by layer errors in layered error application mode. Here, all layers above 0 are truncated because layer 1 is hit. <<fig-G192outputFrameLayer034Error>> is an example where layer 0, 3 and 4 are hit in layered error application mode. All the layers were deleted because of hit of layer 0, and this is equivalent to a totally erased frame.

In individual error application modes, the hit layers are filled with "0"s. In an example give in <<fig-G192outputFrameLayer3ErrorIndividual>>, where layer 3 is hit, all he bits in layer 3 are changed to "0", and the sync header is changed to G192_FER (`0x6B20`) to indicate the presence of remaining layers with errors. <<fig-G192outputFrameLayer134ErrorIndividual>> shows an example where layers 1, 3 and 4 are hit in individual error application mode, and layer 3 and 4 are truncated with layer 1 filled with "0"s. Note here that the Sync header is also changed to G192_FER. Finally, for the case where layers 0, 3 and 4 are hit by layer errors in the individual error application mode, <<fig-G192outputFrameLayer034ErrorIndividual>> gives the resulting frame. Here, all layers are truncated because layer 0 is hit.

== Duo-MNRU: The Dual-mode Modulated Noise Reference Unit

For evaluation of the quality of a system or equipment, it is important to express the quality measure in a unit suitable for comparison with other reference (or well-known) equipments and systems. A common way of representing these figures is by means of relative units, where the quality is expressed by means of a unique figure, in a unidimensional scale.

But it is insuficient to be unidimensional; the scale must be inequivocal, with a universal meaning. As an example, the ACR scale (_Absolute Category Rating_, <<P.800>>, Annex B), which is a scale used for listening opinion tests and has five points termed _Excellent_, _Good_, _Fair_, _Poor_, and _Bad_, is inadequate: besides it shows a continuum of quality points, the meaning of the adjectives are far from universal, varying from language to language, and from person to person. Exchange of information on the performance of these systems and equipments is easier and more consistent with more objective measures. The issue of how the MNRU is to be used as a reference system in subjective tests has been studied in ITU-T Study Group 12, which is described in Recommendation ITU-T P.830 <<P.830>> in its Sections 8.2.2 and 11.

The Modulated Noise Reference Unity (MNRU) was introduced as a means to controlled degradations that are representative of the non-linear distortion introduced by waveform coding techniques. Initially aiming at evaluating the quality of log-PCM waveform coding systems, it has been used in the process of generating several ITU-T standards, such as the ITU-T G.726 (32 kbit/s), G.722, G.728, and G.729.

The concept of such reference unit was published in <<Q001.02.04.02>>. The first system aimed at was the PCM coding with logarithmic compression (today world-wide available by means of the Recommendation ITU-T G.711), whose main characteristic is to have a considerably uniform signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over a wide range of amplitudes. Moreover, the quantizing noise is correlated to the signal: if no signal is present, no quantization noise is produced footnote:[This is obviously academic, because always there will be idle noise, among others, in the absence of an input signal.], and large signals will produce more quantization noise than small ones. Therefore, the main characteristic of this reference unit should output speech corrupted by a speech-correlated noise.

[[fig-1-P.810]]
.Block diagram of the "digital" MNRU. The bandwidth of the output filter h(k) is 0–3400 Hz for the narrowband case, and 0–7000 Hz for the wideband case
image::image12-1.png[]

In <<Q001.02.04.02>>, the speech-correlated noise generation was based on a double-balanced ring modulator, controlled by the input speech signal, which modulates a noise carrier generated by a noise generator having a relatively uniform energy distribution, there in the range of 0--20kHz. This correlated noise is then added to the input signal, with gains applied such that a controlled signal-to-noise ratio is obtained in the output, after the 300--3400Hz band-limiting filter.

With the 1996 revision of the MNRU description published in Recommendation ITU-T P.810 footnote:[Formerly known as Recommendation ITU-T P.81.], specific guidelines were given for "digital implementations" footnote:[The revised P.81 define a "digital implementation" either as a digital hardware implementation or as a software implementation of the MNRU.], eliminating many of the ambiguities possible in earlier descriptions <<Old-P.81>>, as explained in the STL92 manual <<STL92-Manual>>, Chapter 8. <<fig-1-P.810>> shows a block diagram of the "digital" MNRU. Also, this implementation allows for transparent operation on narrowband or wideband speech, hence being known as Dual-mode MNRU, or "Duo-MNRU", for short.

[CAUTION]
----
Special caution must be made when selecting frequency bandwidth of the input signal. The current implementation of tool is only useful for narrowband (200 -- 3400 Hz) and wideband (100 -- 7000 Hz) signal only, and should not be applied to superwideband or fullband signal.
----

=== Description of the Algorithm

The de-facto reference implementation of the MNRU footnote:[Developed by the British Telecom and licenced to Malden Electronics.] is the same of the original description, whose specification can be found in Recommendation ITU-T P.810 <<P.810>> (formerly Recommendation ITU-T P.81 <<Old-P.81>>). This Recommendation describes two MNRU schemes, one called _Narrow-band MNRU_, and another, _Wideband MNRU_. Wideband MNRU is applicable to systems where wideband speech (70--7000Hz) is expected, whereas Narrow-band MNRU is for telephone bandwidth (300--3400Hz). Both narrowband and wideband MNRUs are implemented in this version of the ITU-T Software Tools Library.

The basic block diagram of the P.810 MNRU is found in <<fig-1-P.810>>. In summary, there are two paths, one called _signal path_, another called _noise path_. In the noise path, gaussian noise (uniform in a range at least the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter in the output of the MNRU) is modulated by the incoming signal. The result is then added with the output from the signal path. The gains are set such that the gain (in dB) applied in the output of the noise path is the signal-to-correlated-noise ratio stem:[Q], in the output of the band-pass filter, as calculated in the section to follow.

In analytical terms, the signal corrupted by the modulated noise stem:[y(k)] is

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
y(k) = (G_s x(k) + G_n x(k) n(k)) ** h(k)
++++

where stem:[G_s] is the gain of the signal path, stem:[G_n] is the gain of the noise path, stem:[x(k)] is the input signal, and stem:[n(k)] is the gaussian noise signal; the symbol stem:[**] means convolution, and stem:[h(k)] is the band-pass filter.

If we suppose that the band-pass filter has stem:[|H(f)|=1] in its pass band, and calling stem:[Q] the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at its output, we may write:

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
    10^{Q/10} = \frac{\sigma^2_\xi}{\sigma^2_\nu} =
                \frac{E[\xi^2(k)]}{E[\nu^2(k)]}=
                \frac{G^2_s E[x^2(k)]}{G^2_n E[x^2(k) n^2(k)]}
++++

But stem:[x] and stem:[n] are uncorrelated, and the noise is gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1 (N(0,1)):

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
    10^{Q/10} = \left( \frac{G_s}{G_n} \right)^2
                \frac{\sigma^2_x}{\sigma^2_x \sigma^2_n} =
                \left( \frac{G_s}{G_n} \right)^2

If we set stem:[Gamma_s=0] (stem:[G_s=1]), stem:[Q] is exactly stem:[Gamma_n] (or, stem:[G_n=10^{-Qtext(/)20}]), i.e., the SNR is the gain (in dB) of the noise path and the previous expression may be written as:

in the passband region of stem:[H(f)|].

When both stem:[G_s] and stem:[G_n] are non-zero, the MNRU is in an operational mode normally called _Modulated-noise mode_. This is the most common operation mode.

Alternatively, if one consider stem:[G_s=0], the output of the algorithm is only the correlated noise, at a level stem:[Q] dB below the input signal. This is _Noise-only mode_.

If, on the other hand, stem:[G_n=0], the output of the algorithm is the input signal filtered by stem:[h(k)], with a gain stem:[G_s]; this is the _Signal-only mode_.

=== Implementation

This implementation of the MNRU algorithm can be found in the module `mnru.c`, with prototypes in `mnru.h`. A thorough characterization of this module is presented in <<Duo-MNRU>>. The previous version of the ITU-T STL MNRU was applicable to narrowband signals and evolved from a Fortran implementation which had been used by several laboratories, especially by participants of ETSI's contest for the second generation of Digital Mobile Radio Systems, and was originally written by experts at CSELT/Italy (sometimes referred as _CSELT MNRU_), an implementation fully compliant with the narrowband MNRU specification available in the then-in-force P.81 <<Old-P.81>>.

With the revision of MNRU specification, several changes had to be
made to the STL92 MNRU:

* The need for an upsampling by a factor of 5 before summation of the modulated noise to the input speech was eliminated because now for digital implementations, the bandwidth of the multiplicative noise shall have the bandwidth of the input signal. In the previous version, the noise bandwidth had to be 20 kHz.
* The output filter for digital implementations shall be a low-pass filter, instead of the bandpass filter of the previous version of the MNRU
* The need of an input speech DC-component removal filter was added to the specification.


These changes, especially the elimination of the 5:1 speech data rate conversion, allowed for the implementation of both the narrowband and the wideband MNRU within the same C function, when the output filter is adequately designed <<Duo-MNRU>>, pp.7--12.

The random number generator (RNG) algorithm was also modified to allow for real-time implementations, and the solution adopted was based on Aachen University's approach used by the Host Laboratory for the ITU-T G.729 Selection Tests.

The block diagram of the MNRU implemented in the STL is in <<STL96-MNRU>>.

The MNRU works internally on a sample-by-sample basis but for ease of interface with other speech coding functions, access to it is made on a sample block basis. It should be noted however that the filters have memory, as well as do the random number generator, hence state variables are needed. These state variables have been arranged as fields of a structure whose `type` name is `MNRU_state`. The fields of the structure are:

_seed_:: RNG's seed
_signal_gain_:: Gain of the signal path
_noise_gain_:: Gain of the noise path
_vet_:: Array for intermediate data
_last_xk_:: stem:[x(k-1)] used as memory for the DC-removal filter
_last_yk_:: stem:[xi(k-1)] (see <<STL96-MNRU>>), used as memory for the DC-removal filter
_DLY[2][2]_:: Memory of delayed samples for two second-order stages (first index) for first- and second-order delays (second index)
_A[2][2]_:: Numerator coefficients for the stage indicated by the first index and delay-order inidcated by the second index
_B[2][2]_:: Denominator coefficients for the stage indicated by the first index and delay-order inidcated by the second index
_rnd_state_:: State structure for MNRU's random number generator. Detailed description is found in the section on the random number generator.
_rnd_mode_:: Operational mode of the random number generator
_clip_:: Number of samples clipped in the noise-insertion process

The values of the fields shall not be altered by the user.

*Filters in the MNRU module*

The composite frequency response of the narrowband and wideband MNRU filters is shown in <<MNRU-both-filters>>. <<MNRU-lp-filter>> shows the contribution of the output low-pass filter for (a) the narrowband, and (b) the wideband cases. <<MNRU-hp-filter>> shows the effect of the input DC-removal filter for (a) the narrowband and (b) the wideband operation modes of the MNRU. Details on the design of the output low-pass filters are given in <<Duo-MNRU>>. The frequency responses have been obtained by exciting the MNRU module with digital sinewaves and computing the ratio of input and output signals, in dB.

The input DC-removal filter was implemented using a first-order IIR pole-zero filter defined by

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
H_i(z) = (1-z^(-1))/ (1 - alpha z^(-1))
++++

with stem:[alpha=0.985]. Its -3dB point is at 16 Hz for the narrowband case and at 38 Hz for the wideband case.

The output low-pass filter was implemented using a second-order cascade-form IIR filter with two-sections as illustrated in <<MNRU-IIR>> and defined by the equation:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
H_i(z) = A prod_(k=1)^2 ( a_(0k)+a_(1k)z^(-1)+a_(2k)z^(-2)) / (1+b_(1k)z^(-1)+b_(2k) z^(-2))
++++

IIR filters were chosen because of their low computational complexity when compared to FIR implementations, allowing for a more efficient MNRU implementation.

*Random Number Generator for the MNRU module*

The random number generator (RNG) used in this implementation was
chosen using the following criteria:

* the desired value for Q, stem:[Q_d], and the measured Q, stem:[Q_m], should be very close for a wide range of Q, e.g., Q from 0 to 50 dB.

* it should show a good approximation of a gaussian distribution. This is needed because it is specified in P.810 and more importantly because uniform distributions do not allow good matching between the desired and measured values of Q.

* the algorithm needed to be portable (i.e., identical results are got in different platforms if the same seed is given).


The RNG chosen to be used in the STL92 version of the MNRU was based on Knuth's Subtractive Method <<Recipes>>, <<Knuth>>, Parts 3.2--3.3, which generates adequate random sequences but is computationally intensive and was too complex to be implemented in a real-time digital hardware MNRU.

The implementation used in the ITU-T G.729 8 kbit/s speech codec selection tests was based on a gaussian-noise table lookup, in a manner similar to Malden Electronic's MNRU implementation. footnote:[Malden's MNRU uses a ROM table derived from a Gaussian distribution with 4096 samples uniformly distributed throughout the table. An address in the table is uniformly sampled four times and accumulated to form a gaussian noise sample.] This approach is considerably less computationally intensive than the STL92 approach, and was used to further reduce the complexity of the MNRU implementation.

After several experiments <<Duo-MNRU>>, a table with 8192 gaussian samples was chosen to be used, which is randomly and uniformly accessed 8 times (i.e., an eight-time sample accumulation) to be used by the MNRU algorithm. The gaussian table itself is generated in run-time (rather than being stored in the data memory of the source or object code) using the Monte-Carlo substitution algorithm. The Monte-Carlo algorithm uses a linear congruential generation (LCG) algorithm defined by

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
I_(j) = 69069 I_(j-1) + 1 (text(mod) 2^(32))
++++

which is converted to numbers in the range [0..1] using the upper 24 bits of the 32-bit unsigned long stem:[I_j]. stem:[I_0] is a fixed seed equal to 314159265. This algorithm is used to generate the necessary initial random samples for the substitution algorithm.

Once the table has been filled, during the normal operation of the MNRU, eight successive samples are drawn (uniformily) from the table using a different LCG algorithm

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
L_(j) = 253 L_(j-1) + 1 (text(mod) 2^(24))
++++

of which the upper 13 bits are used to generate random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 8191. stem:[L_0] is a fixed seed equal to 12345. Both LCGs were implemented as in Aachen University's MNRU implementation.

Since different ranges are necessary for table filling and for gaussian sample generation, two different LCG random number generators were used to avoid any additional calculations due to range convertion and to reduce the software load.

Since the Monte-Carlo RNG is used only at startup time, it is not necessary to keep any state variables for it. The sample-drawing RNG however needs to keep stored the previously generated index, which is stored in a structure of type `RANDOM_state`, whose only field is (as defined in `mnru.h`) footnote:[The use of a structure instead of a single variable in the parent structure (`MNRU_state`) allows for unimplemented features to be easily added in a later version of the algorithm.]:

_gauss_:: Index for next random number;

The field in `RANDOM_state` should not be altered by the user in any situation.

The operational modes are defined in `mnru.h`:

                      float _*output_, long _n_, long _seed_, char _mode_,
                      double _Q_);
----

*Prototype:* `mnru.h`

*Description:*

Module for addition of modulated noise to a vector of _n_ samples, according to Recommendation ITU-T P.810, for either the narrowband or the wideband model. Depending on the _mode_, this function:

* adds modulated noise to the _input_ buffer at a SNR level of _Q_ dB, saving to _output_ buffer (_mode_==`MOD_NOISE`);

* puts into _output_ only the noise, without addition of the original signal (_mode_==`NOISE_ONLY`);

* produces in the _output_ a filtered-only (no noise added) version of the `input' samples (_mode_==`SIGNAL_ONLY`);

The symbols `MOD_NOISE`, `NOISE_ONLY`, and `SIGNAL_ONLY` are defined in `mnru.h`.

Although the MNRU algorithm operates on a sample-by-sample basis, `MNRU_process` handles the input data in blocks of _n_ samples, for better computational efficiency.

The implementation of the MNRU algorithm has three operational states, called `MNRU_START`, `MNRU_CONTINUE` and `MNRU_STOP`. With `MNRU_START`, the state variables are set, as well as memory is allocated for the intermediate data, and this needs to be the first operation with the algorithm. Differently from the speech voltmeter module, after the initialization of the state variables, the normal calculations are carried out for the first block of data. Once reset, the algorithm changes the operation state to `MNRU_CONTINUE`, and the next calls to the MNRU algorithm will skip the reset operation. With the last block, it is adivisable to release the memory allocated to the intermediate data. This is accomplished by calling `MNRU_process` with the operational state set as `MNRU_STOP`. These three operational states are defined in `mnru.h` as follows:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
  #define MNRU_START     1
  #define MNRU_CONTINUE  0
  #define MNRU_STOP     -1
----

*Variables:*

_operation_:: One of the defined operation status: `MNRU_START`, `MNRU_STOP`, `MNRU_CONTINUE`.

_s_:: A pointer to a `MNRU_state` structure.

_input_:: Pointer to input float-data vector; must represent 8 or 16 kHz speech samples.

_output_:: Pointer to output float-data vector; will represent 8 or 16 kHz speech samples.

_n_:: Long with the number of samples (`float`) in input.

_seed_:: Initial value for random number generator.

_mode_:: Operation mode: `MOD_NOISE`, `SIGNAL_ONLY`, `NOISE_ONLY` (description above).

_Q_:: Double defining the desired value for the signal-to-modulated-noise stem:[Q] for the output data.


Please note that new values of _seed_, _mode_, and stem:[Q] are considered only when _operation_ is `MNRU_START`, because they are considered as INITIAL state values. Therefore, when the operation is not `MNRU_START`, they are ignored.


*Return value:*

Returns a `(double *)NULL` if not initialized or if initialization failed; returns a `(double *)` to an intermediate data vector if reset was successful or is in the `MNRU_CONTINUE` ("run") operation state.

[[MNRU-Tests]]
=== Portability and compliance

In the development of this module, several steps were taken to assure its compliance to Recommendation ITU-T P.810, which included:

* agreement of expected and measured Q values for tones and speech,
* addition of partial files,
* level of output files,
* frequency response of built-in filters.


Additionally to these objective measurements, a subjective test was performed. The results of this test are found in <<Duo-MNRU>>, where it was concluded that the new MNRU implementation conforms to the P.810 and also behaves more closely to the hardware MNRU than the previous STL92 version.

Additionally to the conformance tests, the algorithm was tested for portability using a 1kHz tone file as input to the algorithm with Q values ranging from 0 to 50 dB in 5 dB steps, and also for the algorithm in the `SIGNAL_ONLY` mode. The processed test files were then compared the the reference processed files (generated on a HP workstation). Test and reference files should be identical. The algorithm was found to compile and execute correctly on MS-DOS under Borland Turbo-C++ 1.0 and under the MS-DOS port of the GNU-C compiler (gcc), on a HP UNIX workstation with cc (non-ANSI) and gcc, on a Sun workstation with cc (non-ANSI) and also on VAX VMS and APX computers.

=== Example code

==== Description of the demonstration programs

One demonstration program is provided for the MNRU module, mnrudemo.c. Irrespective of whether the 16-bit, linear PCM input file is sampled at 8 or 16 kHz, program `mnrudemo.c` will add the multiplicative noise signal to the input signal at the user-defined stem:[Q] level and produce as output a 16-bit, linear PCM file. Optionally, the program can produce a signal-only file (equivalent to a very high Q value) or a noise-only file (the signal path is disconnected).

==== Simple example

The following C code gives an example of a possible use of the Duo-MNRU module. The input file speech is added to a multiplicative noise at a SNR defined by parameter Q. All samples in the file are processed.

== SVP56: The Speech Voltmeter

=== Description of the Algorithm

The specification for the measurement of the active level of speech signals is given in Recommendation ITU-T P.56 <<P.56>> <<P.56-rev>>, and is commonly referred as _speech voltmeter_ footnote:[After the British Telecom and Malden Ltd.'s SV6 Speech Voltmeter.]. Besides the description above, there is complementary information in the ITU-T _Handbook on Telephony_ <<Hndbk-tel>>, section on `Measurement of Speech'.

In summary, the P.56 algorithm takes samples of a signal in the speech bandwidth and calculates its active speech level. This means that silence and idle noise are not taken into account when calculating the level of the signal. Furthermore, _structural pauses_ (pauses in the range of 250 ms which are inherent to the uterance process) are considered in the measurements, but _grammatical pauses_ (pauses between phrases or to emphasise words, generally in the range of 300 ms or more) are excluded, because they do not contribute to speech subjective loudness <<Hndbk-tel>>.

To decide about the activity or inactivity of a speech segment, the algorithm calculates an envelope waveform, or short-term mean amplitude, such that pauses shorter that 100 ms are not excluded, but pauses longer than 350 ms are footnote:[Users will perceive a pause when it lasts more than about 350 ms.]. A signal is considered _active_ when its short-term mean level (envelope) exceeds a threshold level (or _margin_ of ) 15.9 dB below the prevailing speech voltage footnote:[The margin of 15.9 dB has been chosen to be comfortably above the circuit noise, while causing few false detections or failures to detect, having being determined by subjective experiments.], and also during short gaps between such bursts of activity.

A word of caution must be given here: the above mentioned margin above of 15.9 dB has been optimized for speech with a low level of background noise. This means that in the case of generation of material for listening subjective tests, once the original files have been processed (already level equalized), especially by processes that add significant amount of noise to the files (e.g. MNRU for low values of stem:[Q]), the P.56 algorithm shall not be utilized for re-equalization. Since the noise introduced by the processing algorithm will be far above the threshold discussed, the P.56 algorithm will generate wrong measurements of the active level and speech activity. A practical way to observe whether the P.56 may be utilized on processed files is to observe the activity factor: if it increases significantly in relation to the original file's activity factor, then the use of the P.56 for re-equalizations should be discarded.

Another operating assumption for the P.56 Recommendation suggests that the input signal be band-limited (300--3400 Hz for telephony band signals and 100--7000 Hz for wideband signals, as given in Table 3 and Figure 2 of P.56. The revision of P.56 made in 2011 <<P.56-rev>> now states that the input signal should be bandlimited to 50 -- 14000 Hz for superwideband signals and 20 -- 20000 Hz for fullband signals, as given in Annexes B and C, respectively.

The speech voltmeter algorithm is expressed in terms of discrete operations. Because of this, a minimum sampling frequency must be chosen, and the specification in P.56 gives it as 600 Hz. This is well below Nyquist frequency of the digitized sample's normally used for telephony applications, either 8000 or 16000 Hz, which is explained by the fact that the matter of interest here is not signal's frequency content's information, but only signal statistics. This is one of the unspecified details of the P.56 that may cause implementations to differ.

After considering an input sample stem:[x_i], the speech voltmeter performs two operations. First, the total energy of the signal is calculated (stem:[sq]), updating also the number of samples stem:[n] and signal's (long-term) mean level stem:[s]. Second, the envelope (or short-term mean level) stem:[q] of the signal is extracted using a second-order exponential filtering:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
p_i = g * p_(i-1) + (1-g) * :|:x_i:|:
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
q_i = g * q_(i-1) + (1-g) * p_i
++++

with initial states stem:[p_0=q_0=0] and the quantity stem:[g] defined as:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
g = exp(-1text(/)(f * T))
++++

for stem:[f] as the sampling frequency, in Hz, and stem:[T], a time constant for smoothing, equal to 0.030s (30 ms).

With the envelope calculated, the algorithm calculates the number of times that the envelope exceeds each of the threshold levels. The thresholds are represented in a vector stem:[c] of stem:[B-1] positions, where stem:[B] is the resolution (number of bits) of the samples. The values in this vector range from half the maximum possible amplitude down to (or less than) one LSB (Least Significant Bit). In terms of practical implementations, the values of stem:[c_j] are a power of 2:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
c_j = 2^j, j=0 cdots B-2
++++

There are three possible cases footnote:[It is interesting to remark that the lower the threshold level, the greater the activity count for that level will be.]:

* *the envelope exceeds the threshold stem:[c_j]*: increment the _activity counter_ for the quantization level stem:[j], stem:[a_j], and set the timer vector (or _hangover counter_) stem:[h_j] to zero. This operation means that the segment is active as far as the level stem:[j] is concerned, and so the hangover counter must be set to zero, as well as the number of active samples (stem:[a_j]) incremented.

* *the envelope does not exceed the threshold level, but the hangover counter stem:[h_j] is less (or shorter) than stem:[I] samples*: this means that, besides the sample being into a pause segment (because the level is below the threshold), it is a structural pause (because the time spent since the last activity burst is less than 200ms). Therefore, the action here is to increment the activity counter, as well as the hangover counter for the level stem:[j].

* *the envelope does not exceed the threshold level and the hangover time exceeds stem:[I] samples*: this means that the sample is into a pause (because the level is below the threshold); moreover, it is a grammatical pause (because the time spent since the last activity burst is more than 200ms). Therefore, no increments are done.

Then, after all the samples of interest have been considered, three
quantities have been accumulated:

[class=steps]
. total number of samples, stem:[n];
. signal energy, stem:[sq];
. an activity count stem:[a_j] for each threshold level stem:[c_j], stem:[j=0 cdots B-2].

The active level can be evaluated from these three parameters, as follows. First, the long-term mean level is calculated:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
L = 10 log_(10)(sq text(/)n) - 20 log(r)
++++

and the activity counter and threshold vectors are converted to dB:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
A_j = 10 log_(10)(sq text(/)a_j) - 20 log(r)
++++

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
C_j = 20 log_(10)(c_j) - 20 log(r)
++++

where stem:[r] is the 0 dB reference point for the measurements footnote:[This is another unspecified detail in P.56. This implementation's choice is given in next section.].

In sequence, the difference between stem:[A_j] and stem:[C_j] is calculated for each stem:[j]. When this difference lyes below the margin stem:[M] (15.9 dB), then the active level footnote:[The true active level is defined as the one which exceeds the threshold used for its derivation by a stem:[M=15.9] dB.] stem:[A] is found by interpolating between this level latexmath:[\hat{\jmath}] and level latexmath:[\hat{\jmath}-1] (i.e., the nearest level stem:[k] where stem:[A_k-C_k>M], what gives latexmath:[k=\hat{\jmath}-1]), using a bipartition (binary) interpolation algorithm. There are three special cases here:

* When latexmath:[\hat{\jmath}=0], then the active level is zero;
* When latexmath:[|A_{\hat{\jmath}}-C_{\hat{\jmath}}-M| \leq \delta] (where stem:[delta] is the the given tolerance, or degree of accuracy): the active level is latexmath:[A_{\hat{\jmath}}].
* When latexmath:[|A_{\hat{\jmath}-1}-C_{\hat{\jmath}-1}-M| \leq \delta]: the active level is latexmath:[A_{\hat{\jmath}-1}].


The tolerance stem:[delta] is not specified in P.56, hence being implementation-dependent.

Once the active level is found, the only remaining point is the calculation of the activity factor,

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
Activity = 10^(L-A)
++++

or, in percents,

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
Activity_% = 100 * 10^(L-A)
++++


=== Implementation

This implementation of the speech voltmeter algorithm can be found in the module `sv-p56.c`, with prototypes in `sv-p56.h`. This version evolved from a preliminary Fortran implementation provided by Telebrás, Brazil, which was used by several laboratories, in especial by participants of ETSI's contest for the second generation of Digital Mobile Radio Systems.

In Recommendation P.56, there are several undefined issues needed to be resolved for the implementation of this module. Especially, the rate stem:[f] used for the averages and the tolerance, or degree of accuracy, stem:[delta] to be used for the interpolation of the active level have to be defined. Another undefined parameter is the reference level, or 0 dB reference point stem:[r]. The choices of this implementation are shown in the table below:

[%unnumbered]
|===
3+^h| Speech voltmeter parameters
^h| Parameter ^h| Description ^h| Value

^| stem:[f] ^| sampling rate ^| same rate of the input signal.
^| stem:[r] ^| dB reference ^| 0 dBov (see Chapter 2).
^| stem:[delta] ^| tolerance ^| stem:[+-0.5] dB (the same of stem:[M]).
|===

The P.56 algorithm operates on a sample-by-sample basis. However, since most software implementations use blocks (or frames) of samples, the speech voltmeter was designed to work with blocks of samples. Measurements are cummulative, therefore state variables are needed in this approach. These state variables have been arranged as fields of a structure whose name is `SVP56_state`. The fields of the structure are footnote:[All the fields are `double`, except the `float` stem:[f] and the `unsigned long` _a[\]_, _hang[\]_, and _n_.]:

_f_:: Sampling frequency, in Hz
_a[15]_:: Activity count
_c[15]_:: Threshold level
_hang[15]_:: Hangover count
_n_:: Number of samples read since last reset
_s_:: Sum of all samples since last reset
_sq_:: Squared sum of samples since last reset
_p_:: Intermediate quantities
_q_:: Envelope
_max_:: Max absolute value found since last reset
_refdB_:: 0 dB reference point, in [dB]
_rmsdB_:: RMS value found since last reset
_maxP_:: Most positive value since last reset
_maxN_:: Most negative value since last reset
_DClevel_:: Average level since last reset
_ActivityFactor_:: Activity factor since last reset


The user should note that although some fields are of interest to report signal statistics, such as long-term level, extreme values for file, average (or DC) level, etc., these values shall not be altered. See section <<using-P56-fields>>, which describes macros for safe inpection of the parameters of interest.

The algorithm has two operational parts, one that deals with the initialization of the state variables, and is carried out by the function `init_speech_voltmeter`, and the measuring part (or the algorithm itself), carried out by `speech_voltmeter`. These are presented in the next two sections.

==== `init_speech_voltmeter`

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "sv-p56.h"
void init_speech_voltmeter (SVP56_state _*state_, double _f_);
----

*Prototype:* `sv-p56.h`

*Description:*

`init_speech_voltmeter` performs the initialization of the speech voltmeter state variables in the structure pointed by _state_ to the appropriate initial values. The only value required from the user is the sampling rate stem:[f] (in Hz) of the signal that the speech voltmeter is supposed to measure. Note that when measuring new speech material, the state variable shall be re-initialized, otherwise accumulation of previous measurements will happen and wrong measurements will be reported.

*Variables:*

_state_:: Is a pointer to a speech voltmeter state variable.

_f_:: Is the sampling rate (in Hz) of the signal to be measured in the next calls of `speech_voltmeter`. If zero or negative, the sampling rate is initialized to 16000 Hz.

*Return value:*

None.


==== `speech_voltmeter`

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "sv-p56.h"
double speech_voltmeter (float _*buffer_, long _smpno_, SVP56_state _*state_);
----

*Prototype:* `sv-p56.h`

*Description:*

`speech_voltmeter` performs the measurement of the active level of a speech signal according to ITU-T Recommendation P.56. Other relevant statistics are also available in the state variable (for details, see section <<using-P56-fields>> ahead):

* average level;
* maximum and minimum amplitude values;
* rms power, in dB;

*Variables:*

_buffer_:: Is the input sample `float` buffer.

_smpno_:: Is the number of samples in _buffer_.

_state_:: Is a pointer to the state variable buffer. This shall have been initialized by a previous call to `init_speech_voltmeter`.

*Return value:* Returns the active speech level, in dB relative to dBov, as a double.


[[using-P56-fields]]
==== Getting state variable fields

Some macros are provided for the inspection of the speech voltmeter statistics:

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "sv-p56.h"
SVP56_get_rms_dB(SVP56_state _state_);
SVP56_get_DC_level(SVP56_state _state_);
SVP56_get_activity(SVP56_state _state_);
SVP56_get_pos_max(SVP56_state _state_);
SVP56_get_neg_max(SVP56_state _state_);
SVP56_get_abs_max(SVP56_state _state_);
SVP56_get_smpno(SVP56_state _state_);
----

*Description:*

`SVP56_get_rms_dB` and `SVP56_get_DC_level` return respectively the long-term level (in dBov) and the DC level (in the normalized range) calculated for the material, both as a `double`.

`SVP56_get_activity` returns the activity factor as a `double`, in percents (0..100%).

`SVP56_get_pos_max`, `SVP56_get_neg_max`, and `SVP56_get_abs_max` returns respectively the maximum positive, negative and absolute amplitudes found for the input data, as normalized `double` values (range --1.0..+1.0).

`SVP56_get_smpno` returns as a `unsigned long` the total number of samples.

*Variables:*

All the macros expect a valid SVP56 state variable structure (not a pointer!).

=== Portability and compliance

Compliance tests of this module have been done based on the compliance with other existing implementations, especially of the Deutsches Bundespost Telekom Forschungs Institute. Reported results were found to be within the error margins of the P.56 algorithm.

Portability was checked by running the same speech file on a proven platform and on a test platform. Results have to be identical, in especial long-term and active levels, as well as the activity factor. During the development of this tool, the provided demonstration programs (see section <<sv56-examples>>) were used to measure and level-equalize a reference file. These test files are provided in the STL distribution.

This module had portability tested for VAX/VMS with VAX-C and GNU C
(gcc) and for MS-DOS with a number of Borland C/C++ compilers (Turbo
C v2.0, Turbo-C++ v1.0, Borland C++ v3.1). Portability was also
tested in a number of Unix workstations and compilers: Sun
workstation with Sun-OS and Sun-C (`cc`), `acc`, and `gcc`;
HP workstation with HP-UX and `gcc`.

[[sv56-examples]]
=== Examples

==== Description of the demonstration programs

As a part of the speech voltmeter module, two example programs are provided. They are called `sv56demo.c` and `actlevel.c`.

Both example programs calculate the equalization factor to equalize the active speech level of a file 'NdB' dBs below the 0 dBov reference using the algorithm described in this chapter. However, only program `sv56demo.c` carry out the level-equalization of the input file, which is saved in an aoutput file. Levels are reported in dBov.

In general, input files are in integer representation, 16-bit words, 2's complement (i.e., `short` data). In UGST convention, this data must be left-adjusted, _rather_ than right-adjusted. Since the speech voltmeter uses `float` input data, it is necessary to convert from `short` (in the mentioned format) to `float`; this is carried out by the function `sh2fl()`. In addition, the option to `normalize' the input data to the range -1..+1 is selected. After the equalization factor is found, results are reported on the screen, which varies according to the program used and some of the command-line options.

While program `actlevel.c` stops at this point, program `sv56demo.c` proceeds calling the function `scale()` to carry out the (amplitude) equalization using single (rather than double) float precision. After equalization, the samples are converted back to integer (short, right-justified) with the routine `fl2sh()` using truncation, no zero-padding of the least significant bits, left-justification of data, and hard-clipping of data above the overload point. After that, data is saved to the user-specified file .

==== Small example

Following is an simplification of the described demonstration programs. It only measures the statistics for the input file, without carrying out level equalizations and does not implement the several command-line options of `actlevel.c`.

== ITU-T Reverberation tool

=== Introduction

In some hands-free applications (video conference for example), the received sound is composed of direct sound from a speaker and its reverberated components. This reverberation effect corresponds to the modification of the speech signal by the acoustic response of the enclosure. The room effect is usually modeled <<kuttruff>> as a finite impulse response that can be measured between a specific source and the position of the receiver. Thus, it is possible to simulate a given room by convolving its measured impulse response with anechoic signals, which is the goal of this tool. Introduced in STL2005 to produce mono reverberant superwideband audio signals, this tool was updated in STL2009 release to also accommodate fullband audio signals and produce stereo signals. Proper saturation of the reverberated signals was also provided.

=== Description of the algorithm

==== Algorithm

Many approaches are available to add reverberation to a signal. The
most realistic of them is to measure a real room impulse response
and to convolve anechoic signals with it, which is used in the STL.
This is the principle of this tool.

The reverberated signal is computed as

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
s_(rev)(k)=sum_(l=0)^(N-1)IR(l) * s(k-l) ,
++++

where stem:[s(k)] is the original signal at time index k, stem:[s_(rev)] the reverberated signal, stem:[IR] the impulse response of a room, and stem:[N] the number of coefficients in stem:[IR].

The power level of the obtained reverberated signal depends of the experimental conditions of the impulse response measure. As a consequence, the processed signal can be attenuated or amplified. In order to compare reverberated sounds, the user can specify an alignment factor stem:[alpha] which will scale the reverberated sound. This factor can be determined with the SV56 speech voltmeter.

The aligned reverberated signal is computed as

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
s_(rev)'(k)=s_(rev)(k) * alpha ,
++++

where stem:[s_(rev)'] and stem:[alpha] are the aligned reverberated signal, and the scaling factor, respectively.

==== Mono impulse response

Four mono impulse responses are provided with this tool. The first three impulse responses were measured in typical meeting rooms. They are sampled at 32 kHz. Pictures of the two rooms considered are shown in <<STL05-rooms>>. The last mono impulse response were artificially generated to simulate a reverberant meeting room (90 m^3^). It is sampled at 48 kHz.

The list of these mono impulse responses is given below:

* File `visio.IR`: sound capture at 100 cm distance in a small video-conference room,
* File `meeting50.IR`: sound capture at 50 cm distance in a large meeting room,
* File `meeting100.IR`: sound capture at 100 cm distance in the same meeting room.
* File `IR48.IR`: artificially generated.

The geometry characteristics are given in <<tbl-rev-geom-room>>. These rooms were acoustically treated in order to limit the reverberation (filled carpet, acoustically absorbent wall and ceiling). Note that the reverberation reduces the intelligibility of recorded speech and degrades the performance of acoustic echo canceler in case of hands-free communications.

To give more information concerning the acoustical behaviour, the octave-band reverberation time was computed for frequencies below 8 kHz. The values represented in <<tbl-rev-revTime-room>> were estimated by the backward integration method applied in each octave-band of the measured impulse response.

==== Stereo impulse response

In STL 2009, stereo impulse responses were added. These stereo impulse responses were measured in typical meeting rooms with various microphones. The meeting rooms and microphone were selected according to two scenario configurations using two rooms (one per scenario). Pictures of the two rooms are shown in <<STL09-LargeMeetingRoom>> and <<STL09-VideoConferencingRoom>>. Three types of microphone configurations were considered: MS microphone (Sony ECM-MS907), Binaural (two omnidirectional DPA 4060 inserted into the ears of a dummy head), AB microphone (two omnidirectional DPA 4060 microphones spaced 1 m apart). Moreover, the two scenarios were simulated in an anechoic room, i.e. the stereo impulse responses were also measured in this anechoic room for all the positions and all the microphones except for the binaural microphone. The geometry characteristics of the large (for scenario 1) and small (for scenario 2) rooms are given in the <<tbl-geom-charac-room>>. These rooms were acoustically treated in order to limit the reverberation (filled carpet, coustically absorbent wall and ceiling). The acoustic absorption was higher for room of scenario 2 because the room was especially designed for video conferencing.

===== Scenario 1

The first scenario corresponds to a large conference room (see <<STL09-LargeMeetingRoom>>) with 12 participants (12 possible positions). <<STL09-Scenario1>> shows the microphone configuration - AB microphone (two omnidirectional DPA 4060 microphones spaced 1.5 m apart).

===== List of measured stereo impulse responses

A total of 59 stereo impulse responses have been measured resulting in 118 impulse responses. The naming of mono impulse responses is extended to include the left/right channel, further the connection to the room type and microphone is tabulated.

The naming defined here is: `[Room][Reverb][Mic]P[Position].[channel].IR32`, where:

* `Room` is S=Small or L=Large,
* `Reverb` is E=Echoic or A=Anechoic,
* `Mic` is AB or MS or BI=binaural,
* `Position` is a two digit position number,
* `Channel` is L=Left or R=Right.

The detailed naming of stereo impulse responses is given in <<tbl-nameImpulseResponse>>.

===== Office noise recording

Office noises were recorded for the two stereo scenarios with all the microphone configurations <<AC-0809-Q10-26>>. The background noises were the real sounds from air conditioner, video projector, laptop noise (keyboard typing and fan).

==== Impulse response file format

Each sample of the IR is written in the IEEE Standard 754 floating-point representation, with both little-endian and big-endian byte ordering and 32-bit long data type. For example, command lines used to create the impulse responses in Matlab language were:

`fwrite(file_identifier, impulse_response_vector, 'float',0,'ieee-le')`

and

`fwrite(file_identifier, impulse_response_vector, 'float',0,'ieee-be').`

The mono Impulse Response (IR) are stored into file with ".IR" filename extensions. The stereo IR measures are stored into files with ".IR32" filename extensions and the sampling rate is 32 kHz. When applying these IRs, attention must be paid to have consistency between the sampling frequency of input data and the sampling frequency of an IR.

== ITU-T Bitstream truncation tool

=== Introduction

A scalable codec is a highly flexible coding technique that is characterized by a multi-layer bitstream:

* The core layer provides the minimum quality. This layer is a minimum requirement for a decoder to operate, or otherwise the frame is considered lost.
* Upper layers improves quality by increasing bitrate.


The main feature of a scalable codec lies in bit rate flexibility. The bitrate can be adjusted between minimal and maximal values by any component in the communication chain. For instance, to cope with network congestion, the bitrate can be adjusted on a frame by frame basis.

The bitrate modification is very simple as it consists of cutting the bitstream at the right rate, i.e., stripping bits. Apart from this straightforward truncation, no signal processing is required.

To simulate this functionality, a bitstream truncation tool (truncate) was introduced into STL2005. G.192 bitstreams (with or without sync header), G.192 byte-oriented bitstreams (with or without sync header) and binary (compact) bitstreams can be processed with this tool.

=== Description of the algorithm

This tool truncates the bitstream at the desired bitrate (see <<trunc-principle>>). For each frame of an input bitstream, this tool performs the following operations :

[class=steps]
. Read the synchronization word and copy it to the output bitstream;
. Write the new frame length word equal to the number N2 of bits to copy to the output bitstream (N2 depends on the desired bit rate);
. Read the N1 words of the input bitstream and copy the first N2 16-bit words representing the first N2 bits of the input to the output bitstream.

[[trunc-principle]]
.Bitstream truncation principle
image::image15-1.png[]

For example, one frame of the input bitstream will comprise 640 bits for a 32 kbit/s codec operating a frame size of 20 ms. To truncate the 32 kbit/s input bitstream to 14 kbit/s, the output bitstream frame length will be set to 280 for each frame. Only the first 280 words of the 640 words of the input bitstream will be copied in the output bitstream while the last 360 words will be discarded.

== ITU-T frequency response measurement tool

=== Introduction

In order to measure effective codec bandwidth, a frequency response measurement tool was created for the STL2005 <<STL2005>>. At Q10/16 January 2008 meeting, a window overlap option was proposed to make this tool more accurate when dealing with signals with quickly varying frequencies while allowing the tool to be used as before <<AC-0801-Q10-31>> and it was wondered whether this window overlap option should be the default mode. At this January 2008 meeting <<TD297R1>>, it was also suggested that an option to use other window sizes might be useful. In addition, during G.729.1 Superwideband qualification phase, it was found that the speed of the algorithm can be sometime a bit too slow. Therefore, at Q10/16 September 2008 meeting, an update was provided to allow variable frame size usage and to increase the computation speed <<AC-0809-Q10-35>>. In STL2009, the frequency response measurement tool has been revised to introduce these three options: window overlap, variable frame size, and increased computation speed.

=== Description of the algorithm

An input signal is encoded and decoded by the Codec under Test. The periodogram method is then used to compute the average amplitude spectrum difference between a reference signal (e.g. the input file to the speech codec) and a test signal (e.g. the speech signal after encoding and decoding by a codec).

The input and output signals can be treated on a frame by frame basis, with size power of 2 which defaults to 2048 if unspecified. A Hanning window is applied to each input and output frame. The resulting windowed signals are transformed to the frequency domain using a various number of point Fast Fourier transform. The input and output amplitude spectra are then computed and averaged. This tool produces the average amplitude spectrum in ASCII and also produces a bitmap file.

==== Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)

The spectrum is computed using the Discrete Fourier Transform (for
real signals). This is performed as follows :

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
    X(f)=\sum^{NFFT-1}_{k=0}x(k)\cdot \cos{(2\pi fk)} - j\cdot \sum^{NFFT-1}_{k=0}x(k)\cdot \sin{(2\pi fk)}
++++

where _NFFT_ is the number of DFT coefficients.

==== Hanning window generation (DFT)

The Hanning window of length n is defined as :

[latexmath%unnumbered]
++++
    hanning(k)=0.5\cdot [1-\cos(2\pi \cdot \frac{k+1}{n+1})] \mbox{\rule{15mm}{0mm}} (0 \le k \le n-1)
++++

==== Window overlap

In STL2005, the frequency measurement tool used non-overlapping windowed frames to perform the signal analysis. With such non-overlapping Hanning windows, some regions of the signal are set to a very weak value at the window edges. Thus some temporal parts of the signal are not taken into account when applying the Fourier transform, and are not visible in the frequency representation. This is a problem when signals with very quick frequency changes, or continuous changes are considered. This case occurred with the sweep tone signal used in G.722.1 fullband qualification phase. To fix this, an option has been added to the tool to introduce overlapping between two consecutive frames. With this option, a temporal region attenuated by the Hanning window in one frame will be present in next frame. The desired percentage of overlapping can be chosen. If the option is not activated, the tool output remains unchanged.

==== Variable frame size

In STL2005, the window size used for discrete Fourier transform was fixed to 2048 samples and could not provide changes in the frequency resolution. In order provide more freedom, a variable window size was implemented using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The use of FFT implies that the window size is a power of 2, thus, available sizes are: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 and 8192. The dimensions of the bitmap file created by the tool (with option "-bmp") are adapted to the new variable size: if the size is smaller than 2048, then the bitmap file is in the same dimensions as for a 2048-sample bitmap file, because smaller dimensions would give unreadable figures. For windows sizes larger than 2048, the bitmap dimensions are increased to adapt to better frequency resolution.

The <<fig-femaleVoice256>>, <<fig-femaleVoice2048>>, <<fig-femaleVoice8192>> give the bitmap files obtained with `freqresp` tool operating in 256-, 2048- and 8192-sample windowing, respectively. The input file was the artificial female voice standardized by ITU in <<P.50>>.

==== Computation optimization

As the time needed for computing the frequency response of a long audio file can be rather long, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) can be replaced by a split radix (4,2) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm footnote:[Split-radix FFT algorithm, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-radix_FFT_algorithm].

When this option is activated the frame size is limited to power of 2 values (16-32-64-128-256-512-1024-2048-4096-8192).

=== Test Signals

==== Narrow band and wideband

For narrow band and wideband signals, ITU-T SG 12 has been recommending input signal as Rec. ITU-T *P.50 test signals* (p50_m.16p for male voices, and p50_f.16p for female voices). Those signal are meant to be representative of speech signals.

==== Superwideband and fullband

For audio bandwidths greater than wideband, the Rec. ITU-T *P.50 test signals* does not cover enough frequency range for characterizing superwideband or fullband systems.

Therefore, ITU-T SG12 has been suggesting use of Composite Source (CS) Signal as defined in Rec. ITU-T P.501 as it provides sufficient energy in the frequency range above 8 kHz and below 100 Hz. As audio coding systems must also be capable of transmitting signals other than speech, ITU-T SG12 has provided the following guidelines (more details are given in <<AC-0801-Q10-04>>):

[class=steps]
. In case CS-signal cannot be used, it is recommended to use artificial voice according to ITU-T Rec. P.50 and mix it with a broadband pink noise signal. The mixing should be 50%/50% ... If the decoded signal does not sound distorted, it can be used as an input test signal.

. If the signal sounds distorted replace the artificial voice signal by a voice signal consisting of speech sentences (2 sentences, 2 male, 2 female talkers each), such as ones in Rec. ITU-T P.501.

. If this does not lead to the desired result replace the pink noise by a broadband background noise signal providing as much energy as possible in the high frequency range, such as ones in Rec. ITU-T P.501 or ETSI EG 202 396-1.

. Codecs intended to transmit music could be tested with a fullband music signal. Again care should be taken to provide sufficient energy in the high and low frequency range.

== ITU-T Stereo processing tool

=== Introduction

For the development and characterization of stereo algorithms, properly conditioned stereo signals are required. To reuse the existing set of STL single-channel processing tools for conditioning the inputs and outputs in a stereo processing chain, a generic stereo operations tool was developed and introduced in STL2009. This stereo processing tool provides the basic functionalities of interleaving single channel files, splitting stereo files into single channel files, and creating specific single channel down-mix signals from a given stereo input.

=== Description of the algorithm

The tool operates on sample basis on 16-bit resolution input files, and provides the following functionalities:

* Interleaving two single channel files into one single two-channel stereo file.
* Splitting an interleaved two-channel file into individual single channel files
* Down-mixing a two-channel stereo file into a maximum channel energy analysis file (a single channel analysis signal for stereo scene level evaluation purposes).
* Down-mixing a two-channel file into a single channel mono file

<<fig-stereoopFig1>> illustrates the functionality that interleaves two single channel files into one single two-channel stereo file. <<fig-stereoopFig2>> illustrates the functionality that splits an interleaved two-channel file into individual single channel files. <<fig-stereoopFig3>> illustrates the functionality that down-mixes a two-channel file into a maximum channel energy analysis file. <<fig-stereoopFig4>> illustrates the functionality that down-mixes a two-channel file into a single channel mono file.

image::image17-4.png[]

This set of stereo operation functionalities, in combination with the existing STL tools which work on the single channel files, provides a generic framework for stereo file processing.

=== Implementation

==== Data and file format

The tool works on 16-bit sample data (short), independent of sampling frequency. It is assumed that left and right channels always have the same sampling frequency.

File format: 2-channel data is stored in raw header-less files, with each left channel sample stored before the corresponding right channel sample. Single channel files are stored in raw header-less files as required by most existing STL single channel tools.

The input and output file byte order will be the native system byte order.

== BASOP: ITU-T Basic Operators

=== Overview of basic operator libraries

Since the standardization of G.729 and G.723.1 footnote:[For older standards (G.711, G.726, G722, G.727, G.728), their C-codes are included in the software tools library.], ANSI-C source codes constitute integral parts of the ITU-T speech and audio coding Recommendations and their specification relies on bit-exact fixed-point C code using library of basic operators that simulates DSP operations. The fixed-point descriptions of G.723.1 and G.729 are based on 16- and 32-bit arithmetic operations defined by ETSI in 1993 for the standardisation of the half-rate GSM speech codec. These operations are also used to define the GSM enhanced full-rate (EFR) and adaptive multi-rate (AMR) speech codecs <<G.191>>.

In STL2005, the version 2.0 of the ITU-T Basic Operators bears the following additional features compared to the version 1.x:

[class=steps]
. New 16-bit and 32-bit operators;
. New 40-bit operators;
. New control flow operators;
. Revised complexity weight of version 1.x basic operators in order to reflect the evolution of processor capabilities.

In STL2009, that is version 2.3, in addition to some minor fixes in the ITU-T Basic Operators and guidelines of data move counters, the following new additional tools were added:

* Program ROM estimation tool for fixed-point C Code;
* Complexity evaluation tool for floating-point C Code.

In STL2019, new operators were introduced to account for modern DSP architectures:

[class=steps]
. Enhanced 32-bit operators;
. New unsigned 32-bit operators;
. New 64-bit operators;
. New complex operators;
. New control flow operators;
. Revised complexity weights in order to reflect the evolution of processor capabilities.

<<tbl-operators-weight>> provides an overview of the complexity weight history for each basic operator.

=== Description of the 16-bit and 32-bit basic operators and associated weights

This section describes the different 16-bit and 32-bit basic operators available in the STL, and are organized by complexity ("weights"). The complexity values to be considered (since the publication of the STL2005) are the ones related to the version 2.0 and subsequent versions of the module. When the basic operator did not exist in the previous version of the library (version 1.x), it is highlighted as follows: stem:[->] [smallcap]#New in v2.0#. In STL2009, `round()` operator was renamed as `round_fx()` and `saturate()`, function was made unaccessible from applications, because it was an internal procedure.

==== Variable definitions

The variables used in the operators are signed integers in 2's complements representation, defined by:

`v1`, `v2`:: 16-bit variables

`L_v1`, `L_v2`, `L_v3`:: 32-bit variables

==== Operators with complexity weight of 1

The operation is performed in *fractional mode*: when L_v1 and L_v2 are in 1Q31 format, the result is produced in 1Q63 format; L_v3_h bears the 32 most significant bits while L_v3_l bears the 32 least significant bits.

==== Coding Guidelines

The following recommendations must be followed in the usage of the
40-bit operators:

[class=steps]
. Only 40-bit variables local to functions can be declared. Declaration of arrays and structures containing 40-bit elements must not be done.
. 40-bit basic operators and 16/32-bit basic operators must not be mixed within the same loop initialized with a FOR(), DO or WHILE() control basic operator.
+
When nested loop software structure is implemented, this recommendation applies to the most inner loops. This enables to have, for instance, an outer loop containing 2 inner loops, with the 1st inner loop using 40-bit basic operators and the 2nd inner loop using 16/32-bit basic operators. However, whenever possible, even such 2 level loop structure configuration should only use either 40-bit basic operators or 16/32-bit basic operators.
+
Current version (2.0) of the operator implementation does not evaluate the complexity associated to the mixing of 40-bit and 16/32-bit operators. Subsequent versions may do so.

Multiplies a signed 16-bit var1 by signed 16-bit var2, shifts the result left by 1 and sign extends to 64-bits; add this 64 bit value to the 64 bit W_acc without saturation control, and returns a 64 bit result. +
The operation is performed in fractional mode. +
For example, if var1 is in 1Q15 format and var2 is in 1Q15 format, then the product is in 33Q31 format which is then added to W_acc (in 33Q31 format) to provide a final result in 33Q31 format.

`W_msu_16_16(W_acc, var1, var2)`

*This operator is SIMD and VLIW friendly*

[align=left]
Multiplies a signed 16-bit var1 by signed 16-bit var2, shifts the result left by 1 and sign extends to 64-bit; subtracts this 64 bit value from the 64 bit W_acc without saturation control, and returns a 64 bit result. +
The operation is performed in fractional mode. +
For example, if var1 is in 1Q15 format and var2 is in 1Q15 format, then the product is in 33Q31 format which is then subtracted from W_acc (in 33Q31 format) to provide a final result in 33Q31 format.

`W_deposit32_l(L_var1)`

Deposits the 32 bit L_var1 into the 32 LS bits of the 64-bit output. The 32 MS bits of the output are sign extended.

`W_deposit32_h(L_var1)`

`W_sat_l(W_v1)`

[align=left]
Saturates the 64-bit variable W_v1 to 32-bit value and returns the lower 32 bits. +
For example, a 64-bit wide accumulator is helpful in accumulating 16*16 multiplies without checking for saturation. However, at the end of the multiply-and-accumulate loop, we need to return only the 32-bit value after checking for saturation. +
If W_v1 is in 33Q31 format, then the result returned will be saturated to 1Q31 format.

`W_sat_m(W_v1)`

[align=left]
Arithmetically shifts right the 64-bit variable W_v1 by 16 bits; saturates the 64-bit value to 32-bit value and returns the lower 32 bits. +
For example, a 64-bit wide accumulator is helpful in accumulating 32*16 multiplies without checking for saturation. A 32*16 multiply gives a 48-bit product; at the end of the multiply-and-accumulate loop, the result is in the lower 48 bits of the 64-bit accumulator. Now an arithmetic right shift by 16 bits will drop the LSB 16 bits. Now we should check for saturation and return the lower 32 bits. +
If W_var is in 17Q47 format, then the result returned will be saturated to 1Q31 format.

`W_shl_sat_l(W_1, var1)`

`W_round32_s(W_var1)`

[align=left]

Multiplies the signed 32-bit variable L_var1 with signed 32-bit variable L_var2. Shift the product left by 1 with saturation control. Returns the 64-bit result. +
The operation is performed in fractional mode. +

[align=left]
Multiplies the signed 32-bit variable L_var1 with signed 32-bit variable L_var2. Returns the 64-bit result. +

==== Coding guidelines

===== When to use IF() instead of if()?

The *IF*() macro must be used instead of the classical C statement *if*(), wherever:

* There is an else or else if statement,
* There is *strictly more than one basic operators* to condition,
* There is at least a function call to condition.
* There is a control basic operator to condition.

    z = add(z, sub(y, x)); /* more than one basic ops */
    if (z == 0)
    Decode(); /* function call */
    something();
----

must be written as:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    IF (x == 0)
    z = add(z, sub(y, x));
    IF (z == 0)
    Decode();
    something();
----

While below code must stay untouched since *only one* basic operator is conditioned.

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    if (x == 0)
    z = add(z, x); /* one basic op */
    something();
----

===== When to use FOR() and WHILE() macros?

The `FOR()` and `WHILE()` macros must be used to differentiate loops which can be handled by a h/w loop controller from complex loops which need to be controlled by additional control software.


* Follows an example of a *simple h/w loop* that must be designed with the *FOR()* macro. It will iterate C-statement E0 to E20 a number of times *known at loop entry* (and at least once). Therefore, for such loops, there is no complexity associated to the computation of the decision to loop back or not:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
        /* var1 > 0 is ensured  */
        FOR (n = 0; n < var1; n++) {
        E0;
        /* never do anything that impacts "var1" nor "n" value */
        E20;
        }
----

* Follows an example of a *complex s/w loop* that must be designed with the *WHILE()*. It will iterate C-statement E0 to E20 a number of times *undefined* at loop entry (eventually 0 times). Indeed, at the end of one loop iteration, the decision to loop back depends on the processing done within the elapsed iteration.

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
        /* do not need to ensure n < var1 at loop entry */
        WHILE (n < var1) {
        E0;
        /* can do anything that impacts "var1" or "n" value */
        E20;
        }
----

ANSI-C defines *for*() structures with *while*() structures, but by differencing the *FOR*() and *WHILE*() macro usage, a better complexity evaluation of the loop controlling is made.

* A loop defined with FOR() macro:
** *Only counts the initial set-up* of the h/w loop controller with a complexity weight of 3.
** *Must iterate at least once*.
** Has a complexity *independent* of the number of iterations that are performed.

* A Loop defined with WHILE() macro:
** Counts, at *every single iteration* which is executed, *the complexity associated to the computation of the decision to loop back or not*.
** *Can be executed 0 times*.
** Has a complexity *proportional* (by a factor of 4) to the number of iterations that are performed.


===== When to use DO and WHILE() macros?

It is important to *modify* below C code:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    do {
    x = sub(x, y)
    } while (x < 0);
----

into following one:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    DO {
    x = sub(x, y)
    } WHILE (x < 0);
----

The following code is also possible but, although the associated complexity computation will be identical, it can generate parsing errors by some source code editors which perform on-the-fly syntax checking.

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    do {
    x = sub(x, y)
    } WHILE (x < 0);
----

===== Testing an expression equality

*_if(expression) {...} and while(expression) {...} C statements._*

All arithmetic tests on data must be presented as a comparison to zero. To perform comparison between two variables (or a variable and a non-zero constant), a subtraction (*sub* or *L_sub* or *L40_sub*) must be performed first.

For example, below examples leads to an under evaluation of the complexity:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    if (a > 3) { }
    while (a != 5) { } ...
----

While, below examples leads to a correct evaluation of the complexity:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    if (sub(a,3) > 0) { }
    while (sub(a, 5) != 0) { } ...
----

If multiple condition need to be evaluated and merged, one *test*() operator must be used for each additional test to be done.

Example 1:

The following code ...

[%unnumbered]
----
    if ( (a > b) && (c > d)) {}
----

...must be modified to:

[%unnumbered]
----
    *test*();
    if ( (sub( a, b) > 0) && (sub( c, d) > 0)) {}
----

Example 2:

The following code ...

[%unnumbered]
----
    if ( (a > b)
    && (c > d)
    ||(e > f)) {}
----

...must be modified to:

[%unnumbered]
----
    *test*();
    *test*();
    if (  (sub( a, b) > 0)
    && ( sub( c, d) > 0)
    || (sub( e, f) > 0)) {
----


*_(condition) ? (statement1) : (statement2)_*

The ternary operator "*? :*" must not be used since it does not enable the evaluation of the associated complexity.

Therefore, instead of writing:

[%unnumbered]
----
    (condition) ? (statement1) : (statement2)
----

One must write:

[%unnumbered]
----
    IF(condition)
      statement1;
    ELSE
      statement2;
----

Whenever it is possible to avoid the *else* clause, one should write:

[%unnumbered]
----
      statement2;
      IF(condition)
        statement1;
----

And whenever *statement1* is *one and only one basic operator* (control operator excluded), one can write:

[%unnumbered]
----
    statement2;
    if(condition)
      one_and_only_one_basic_operator;
----

*_for(expresion1; expression2; expression3)_*

A "*for*" C statement must be limited to initializing, testing and incrementing the loop counter. The following C code statement is an example of incorrect usage:

[%unnumbered]
----
    for(i=0, j=0; i<N & w>0 ; i++, j+=3)
----

It must be replaced by:

[%unnumbered]
----
    j=0;
    for(i=0; i<N ; i++) {
      j = add(j,3);
      if(w > 0)
        break;
    }
----

Actually, in order to respect the other recommendations, it must
be replaced by:

[%unnumbered]
----
    j=0;
    FOR(i=0; i<N ; i++) {
      j = add(j,3);
      if(w > 0){
        BREAK;
      }
    }
----


=== Complexity associated with data moves and other operations

==== Data moves

Each data move between two 16-bit or two 32-bit variables, *move16*() and *move32*() operators respectively, has a complexity weight of 1.

[class=steps]
. A 16-bit variable cannot be directly moved to a 32-bit or 40-bit variable.
. A 32-bit variable cannot be directly moved to a 16-bit or 40-bit variable.
. A 40-bit variable cannot be directly moved to a 16-bit or 32-bit variable.

For above 3 types of moves, functions such as the following ones
must be used:

[%unnumbered]
[cols="^,^,^"]
|===
| round_fx() | round40() | L_saturate40()
| extract_h() | Extract40_H() | L_Extract40()
| extract_l() | Extract40_L() | L40_deposit32()
| L_deposit_h() | L40_deposit_h() |
| L_deposit_l() | L40_deposit_l() |
|===

There will be no extra weighting for data move when using above functions: the weighting of the data move is already included in the weighting of these functions.

Data moves are only counted in the following cases:

[class=steps]
. A data move from a constant to a variable;
. A data move from a variable to a variable;
. A data move of the result of a basic operation to an array;
. A typecast from a Word8 to a Word16 variable;
. A typecast from a Word8 to a Word32 variable.


===== Is it necessary to count the complexity of typecast from Word8 to Word16 or Word32?

Following example shows necessity:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    const Word8 tbl[2] = {0x1, 0x2};

    Word16 tmp;
    tmp = add((Word16 )tbl[0], (Word16 )tbl[1]); move16(); move16();
    a = my_function((Word16 )tbl[0], (Word16 )tbl[1]); move16(); move16();
    /* assuming my_function requires 2 Word16 parameters. */
----

===== Is it necessary to count an address calculation when initializing a pointer?

For a case when initializing a pointer with an address, extra weight
count, e.g. move16(), is not necessary because address computation is
not counted as a part of the complexity. For example:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    Word16 *p;
    p = &(array[1]); /* move16() not necessary */
----

===== Does return value assignment need to be counted?

When a return value of a function is assigned, it does not require move16() count. For example:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    Word16 a = function(b); /* move16() not necessary */
----

Here is another example that does not require copy count:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    Word16 function(Word16 b) {
    return (add(b, 1)); /* move16() not necessary */.
    }
----

Introducing dummy functions to avoid extra basop counts must be avoided.

===== What to do with return value of a macro?

When copying return value of a complex macro to a variable, it does not require extra weight count as in a return value of a function:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    Word32 w = Mpy_32(); /* move32() not required */
----

==== Other operations

Address computation must be excluded from the complexity evaluation. However, when extremely complex address computations are done, these address computations should be resolved using the basic operations, in order to account for the associated complexity.

For example, incrementation of an address by one does not require an extra count, but followings would be considered complex:

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
    j=0; move16();
    FOR( i=0; i<5; i++) {
    sum = add(sum, array[j]);
    j = add(j,i);
    }"
----

=== Program ROM estimation tool for fixed-point C Code

==== Tool Description

This tool is developed to help the estimation of program ROM of applications written using ITU-T Basic Operator libraries. This tool counts the number of calls to basic operators in a C source file, and also the number of calls to user defined functions. The sum of these two numbers gives an estimation of the required PROM for this C source file. Note that RAM and data ROM have to be estimated by other means.

The tool is meant to provide a consistent, platform independent method of obtaining and reporting program ROM estimates.

This tool works as follows:

* In a first step, a pre-processing removes C and C++ style comments to avoid counting functions that are commented out. The result is written in the file with extension `.c_pre`. Note that the pre-processor directives are not taken into account, so functions of the source code deactivated by a pre-processor directive are counted by the tool.

* In a second step, the pre-processed file is analysed and the number of basic operators (first group) and all other functions (second group) are counted. This second group of other functions is divided into two sub-groups as it is possible to define a so called "black list" that contains functions that should not be counted in the program ROM. Typically these functions are memory allocation functions (malloc, free,...), file manipulation functions (fopen, fclose, fwrite, printf,...) or even functions related to complexity counting (setCounter, WMOPS_output, fwc,...). This list is already initialized and can be further edited and completed if needed. The other subgroup is called user defined functions as it consists of all functions which are neither basic operators nor blacklist functions.

At the end of the execution, the results are printed out on the standard output indicating the names of the C file and of the pre-processed file, the number of calls to basic operators, the number of calls to user defined functions, and the number of calls to blacklist functions.

When a result file name is also given as second optional argument of the command line, a summary of the results is written in this result file in append mode. Thus, to estimate the program ROM of a given application, the tool has to be run for all C files of the application using the same result file. Each call adds a new line in for the input C file. Though the format of the result file is a text file with tab separators, it is advised to name it with .xls extension and open it with Microsoft Excel.

The Excel file has as many rows as the number of C files. For each row, there are four columns: the first column contains the ANSI C input file name, the second the number of calls to basic operators, the third the number of calls to user defined functions and the fourth the number of calls to blacklist functions. In this way the program ROM of an application containing several C source files can be easily estimated as the sum of the numbers in the second and third columns.

By defining the pre-pocessor directives `VERBOSE_BASOP`, `VERBOSE_FUNC` or `VERBOSE_BLACKLIST_FUNC` the detailed list of called function for basic operator functions, user defined functions and blacklist functions respectively, is also printed out. This allows an easy cross-check of the results.

This tool is optimized for the basic operators of STL2005 or later. In case of estimating the program ROM of an application written using earlier STL basic operators, it is advised to define the pre-processor directive `OLD_STL`. In this case some C operators like if, do are not counted directly as they should be accompanied by the basic operator `test()`, and this later is counted by the tool.

==== Tool implementation

The tool consists of one ANSI C file `basop_cnt.c`.

To use this tool the C source file `basop_cnt.c` has to be compiled and linked. The resulted executable file has to be called for each C source file of the examined application, with the following syntax:

[%unnumbered]
[source,sh]
----
basop_cnt input.c [result_file_name.txt]
----

where _input.c_ is an ANSI C file and _result_file_name.txt_ the ouput result file.

If needed to further edit the black list of functions that should not be counted in the program ROM, modify `const char blacklist[][20] = {...}` in `basop_cnt.c` before compilation.


==== Example

[align=left]

   8  calls to blacklist tokens
----

If the pre-processor directive `VERBOSE_BLACKLIST_FUNC` is defined, the list of the 8 blacklist functions found is also given:

=== Complexity evaluation tool for floating-point C Code

==== Introduction

The Complexity evaluation tool for floating-point C Code enables to estimate the number of WMOPS (Weighted Million Operations per Second) and Program ROM of a floating-point implementation of speech and audio codecs. An estimation of the complexity that would be obtained after conversion of a floating-point source code into the corresponding fixed-point implementation is also computed.

==== Tool Description

This tool consists of complexity counters (macros) collected in an ANSI C library. The library is intended to be included in a codec algorithm, each line of which is instrumented with the complexity counters. The tool measures the computational complexity and program ROM based on a floating-point C source code instrumented with the counters. Note that RAM and table ROM have to be estimated by other means.

The tool is meant to provide a consistent, platform independent method of obtaining and reporting complexity estimates. The weights assigned with arithmetic operations reflect as much as possible those of the ITU-T Fixed-point Basic Operators. It should be noted, however, that the methodology cannot give an exact correspondence with the complexity of the fixed-point implementation and only estimation is given. Among several other reasons, this is because the scaling related operations (including saturation and overflow control) used in the fixed-point implementation have no correspondence in the floating-point implementation.

The essential feature of the tool is that the instructions need to be executed to be counted. Therefore the codec should be executed in conditions that give the broadest possible coverage of the source code (i.e. usually at the highest bitrate in frame-error conditions).

==== Complexity Verification Method

The computational complexity associated with a given speech and audio codec can be specified in terms of the number of instructions required per frame. The type and number of operations returned by the algorithm on a per-frame basis are specified for both the encoder and the decoder. Algorithms are broken down into sub-processing elements, each having a detailed breakdown of the types of operations and the number of operations required to complete the sub-processing element. Certain operations require several instructions in order to be computed. Thus all operations have associated with them a weight, indicative of this expansion, and given in <<tbl-flp-counters>> (column Complexity Weights).

The total number of instructions required per frame is then given by summing the total number of weighted operations. This number represents the basic computational complexity of the codec in instructions per frame. The complexity in WMOPS is then obtained by dividing the number of operations per frame by the length of the frame in seconds. The complexity estimates are computed assuming average and worst case number of operations both per frame and per second. The complexity is computed separately for the encoder and the decoder.

The operation count performed for the complexity measurement is re-used to get an estimate of the program memory. This operation count specifies operations in loops, loop counters, operations in subroutines, and subroutine counters. Each operation is weighted using the memory weights from the <<tbl-flp-counters>> (column Memory Weights) to produce a memory usage in words. Operations inside loops are counted only once. Similarly operations inside subroutines are counted only once.

==== Tool implementation

The tool consists of one header file _flc.h_ and one ANSI C library file _flc.c_. Both files must be included into the project to use this tool. Further, the code must be instrumented using counters defined in the <<tbl-flp-counters>> (column Counter). Finally the following functions are needed:

* To initialize internal data structures, the function `FLC_init()` must be called before any counters are defined, usually at the beginning of the codec algorithm.
* The function `FLC_frame_update()` must be called at the end of the frame loop in order the FLC tool can keep track of the per-frame maxima to evaluate the worst-case conditions.
* The function `FLC_end()` computes and prints the complexity of the program and is called usually at the end of the codec algorithm.
* The separate complexity of subroutine/subsection is estimated by calling the function `FLC_sub_start(name_of_subroutine)` that must be matched with calling the function `FLC_sub_end()` at the end of the subsection/subroutine.

Note that once the code is instrumented using the complexity counters and functions, the compilation switch `DONT_COUNT` can be activated to suppress the functionality of the tool with no need of removing the complexity counters and functions from the code.

==== Scaling factor

A scaling factor is used to estimate and print the complexity that would be obtained after conversion of a floating-point source code into the corresponding fixed-point implementation. The scaling factor (`FLC_SCALEFAC`) is defined in file _flc.h_ and its value is set to 1.1.

==== Tests and Portability

Compiled and tested on a PC (Windows XP) platform with MS Visual C++ 2005 and in Cygwin with gcc (version 3.4.4).

==== Example code

A demonstration program, _flc_example.c_, serves as an example and guideline for the illustration of the tool usage. To compile a demonstration program, Windows MSVC and Cygwin gcc makefiles are enclosed as _makefile.cl_ and _makefile.unx_, respectively.

== UTILITIES: UGST utilities

This module does not relate to any ITU-T Recommendation, but implements several general-purpose routines, that are needed when using other STL modules.

In the process of implementing the STL modules, it was found that the interfacing between data representations (`float` and `short`; `serial` and `parallel`) could present problems. Hence, algorithms implementation these functions have been made available in the ITU-T STL. Additionally, a scaling routine for application of gain and loss to speech samples is included.

[[def-serial-parallel]]
=== Some definitions

Some functions in this module convert between a serial format and a parallel format. The _parallel format_ is defined to be a representation in which all the bits in a computer word have an information content, as in a multi-level representation of data. Speech samples in a computer file are a typical example of a parallel representation. A _serial format_ is defined as the representation of the data where each computer word refer to a single bit of information. An example would be the sequence of bits sent in a communication channel refering to an encoded digital signal. A _serial bitstream_, in the context of the ITU-T STL, refers to a multi-level representation of information bits in which each of the "hard" bits `'0'` or `'1'` are mapped respectively to the so-called softbits `0x007F` and `0x0081`, to which an error probability is associated. These softbits are stored in 16-bit right-justified words. In addition, if the bitstream is compliant to the bitstream signal representation in Annex B of Recommendation ITU-T G.192, the serial bitstream "payload" described above will be preceed by a synchronization header. A _synchronization header_ is composed by a synchronization word followed by a frame length word. _Synchronization words_ are words in the bitstream in the range `0x6B21` to `0x6B2F`. A synchronization word equal to `0x6B20` indicates a frame loss. The _frame length word_ is a two-complement word representing the number of softbits in the payload. Therefore, the frame length word does not account for the synchronization header length (which equals two, by definition). Typically (as in the EID module), encoded signals are represented using the bitstreams with a synchronization header, while error patterns are represented without a synchronization header.

=== Implementation

The functions implemented in this module are:

`scale`:: for level change of a float data stream;
`sh2fl*`:: for conversion from `short` to `float`;
`fl2sh`:: for conversion from `float` to `short`;
`serialize_*`:: for conversion from parallel to serial data representation;
`parallelize_*`:: for conversion from serial to parallel data representation;


Following you find a summary of calls to these functions.

==== `scale`

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "ugst-utl.h"
long scale (float _*buffer_,long _smpno_,double _factor_);
----

*Prototype:* `ugst-utl.h`

*Description:*

Gain/loss insertion algorithm that scales the input buffer data by a given factor. If the factor is greater than 1.0, it means a gain; if less than 1.0, a loss. The basic algorithm is:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
y(k)= x(k) * text(factor)
++++

Please note that:

* the scaled data is put into the same location of the original data, in order to save memory space, thus overwriting original samples;
* input data buffer is an array of `floats`;
* scaling precision is single (rather than double precision).

*Variables:*

_buffer_:: Float data vector to be scaled.
_smpno_:: Number of samples in _buffer_.
_factor_:: The `float` scaling factor.


*Return value:*

Return the number of scaled samples.

==== `sh2fl`

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "ugst-utl.h"
void sh2fl (long _n_, short _*ix_, float _*y_, long _resolution_, char _norm_);
----

*Prototype:* `ugst-utl.h`

*Description:*

Common conversion routine. The conversion routine expects the fixed point data to be in the range between --32768..32767. Conversion to float is done by taking into account only the most significant bits (i.e., input samples shall be left-justified), normalizing afterwards to the range --1..+1, if _norm_ is 1.

In order to maintain a match with its complementary routine `fl2sh`, a set of macros have been defined for resolutions in the range of 16 to 12 bits (see below for the complementary definitions):

* _sh2fl_16bit_: conversion from 16 bit to float
* _sh2fl_15bit_: conversion from 15 bit to float
* _sh2fl_14bit_: conversion from 14 bit to float
* _sh2fl_13bit_: conversion from 13 bit to float
* _sh2fl_12bit_: conversion from 12 bit to float



*Variables:*

_n_:: Is the number of samples in ix[ ];
_ix_:: Is input short array pointer;
_y_:: Is output float array pointer;
_resolution_:: Is the resolution (number of bits) desired for the input data in the floating-point representation.
_norm_:: Flag for normalization:
+
--
[align=left]
_1_: normalize float data to the range --1..+1; +
_0_: convert from short to float, leaving data in the range: -32768>>(16--resolution) .. 32767>>(16--resolution), where >> is the right-shift operation.
--

*Return value:*

None.

==== `sh2fl_alt`

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "ugst-utl.h"
void sh2fl_alt (long _n_, short _*ix_, float _*y_, short _mask_);
----

*Prototype:* `ugst-utl.h`

*Description:*

Common conversion routine alternative to routine `sh2fl`. This conversion routine expects the fixed-point data to be in the range -32768..32767. Conversion to float is done by taking into account only the most significant bits, indicated by _mask_. Conversion to float results necessarily in normalised values in the range stem:[-1.0 <= y < +1.0].


*Variables:*

_n_:: Number of samples in ix[ ].
_ix_:: Pointer to input short array.
_y_:: Pointer to output float array.
_mask_:: Mask determining how many bits of the input samples are to be considered for convertion to float. Bits `'1'` in _mask_ indicate that this bit in particular will be used in the conversion. For example, _mask_ equal to `0xFFFF` indicates that all 16 bits of the word are used in the convertion, while _mask_ equal `0xFFFE`, `0xFFFC`, `0xFFF8`, or `0xFFF0` will force respectively only the upper 15, 14, 13, or 12 most significant bits to be used.

*Return value:*

None.


==== `fl2sh`

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]
[source,c]
----
#include "ugst-utl.h"
long fl2sh (long _n_, float _*x_, short _*iy_, double _half_lsb_, unsigned
            _mask_);
----

*Prototype:* `ugst-utl.h`

*Description:*

Common quantisation routine. The conversion routine expects the floating-point data to be in the range between --1..+1, values outside this range are limited. Quantization is done by taking into account only the most significant bits. Therefore, the quantized (or converted) data are located left justified within the 16-bit word, and the results are in the range:

* -32768, ..., -1, 0, +1, ..., +32767, if quantized to 16 bit
* -32768, ..., -2, +2, ..., +32766, if quantized to 15 bit
* -32768, ..., -4, +4, ..., +32763, if quantized to 14 bit
* -32768, ..., -8, +8  ..., +32760, if quantized to 13 bit
* -32768, ..., -16,+16, ..., +32752, if quantized to 12 bit

The operation may be summarized as:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
y_k = (x_k +- h) & m
++++

where stem:[x_k] is the float number, stem:[y_k] is the quantized number, stem:[h] is the value of half-LSb for the resolution desired (which is added to stem:[x_k] if the latter is positive or zero, or subtracted otherwise), and stem:[m] is the bit mask (to assure that the bits below the LSb are `0`). The operation stem:[=] is a truncation, and stem:[&] is a bit-wise AND operation. The appropriate values for stem:[h] are determined by:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
h = 0.5 * 2^(16-B) = 2^(15-B)
++++

where stem:[B] is the desired resolution in bits. As an example, if data is to be stored with 15 bits of resolution (equivalent to -16384..+16383, in right-justified notation), the rounding number stem:[h] is 1.0, because the smallest number in the output buffer can be +1 or -1. The mask stem:[m], by its turn, is

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
m = 0xFFFF < < (16-B)
++++

where stem:[< <] is the left-shift bit operation with zero-padding from the right. For the same example, stem:[m] is `0xFFFE`, i.e., only bit 0 of the samples is zeroed.

To facilitate to the use of the `fl2sh`, a set of macros has been defined for quantizations in the range of 16 to 12 bits (see `ugst-utl.h`):

* _fl2sh_16bit_: conversion from float to 16 bit
* _fl2sh_15bit_: conversion from float to 15 bit
* _fl2sh_14bit_: conversion from float to 14 bit
* _fl2sh_13bit_: conversion from float to 13 bit
* _fl2sh_12bit_: conversion from float to 12 bit


In some cases truncated data is needed, what can be accomplished by setting stem:[h=0]. For example, at the input for A-law encoding, truncation is necessary, not rounding. On the other hand within recursive filters rounding is essential. Hence, this routine serves both cases.

Concerning the location of the fixed-point data within one 16 bit word, it is more practical to have the decimal point immediately after the sign bit (between bit 15 and 14, if the bits are ordered from 0..15). Since this is well defined, software that processes the quantized data needs no knowledge about the resolution of the data. It is not important whether tha data comes from A or stem:[mu] law decoding routines or from 12-bit (13, 14, 16-bit) A/D converters.

It should be noted that this routine only processes data in a normalized form (stem:[-1.0 <= x < +1.0]); it shall not be used if data is in the `short` range (-32768.0 .. 32767.0).

*Variables:*

_n_:: Number of samples in x[ ].
_x_:: Pointer to input `float` array.

                               long _resol_, char _sync_);
----

*Prototype:* `ugst-utl.h`

*Description:*

Routines `serialize_right_justified` and `serialize_left_justified` convert a frame of _n_ right- or left-justified samples with a resolution _resol_ into a right-justified, serial soft bitstream of length _n.resol_. If the parameter _sync_ is set, a serial bitstream compliant to the Annex B of Recommendation ITU-T G.192 will be generated. In this case, the the length of the bitstream is increased to _(n+2).resol_. footnote:[The option of adding only the synchronization word, as implemented in the STL92, is no longer available with this function since the STL96.] It should be noted that the least significant bits of the input words are serialized first, such that the bitstream is a stream with less significant bits coming first.

The only difference between these functions is that function `serialize_right_justified` serializes right-justified parallel data and function `serialize_left_justified` serialize left-adjusted data.

It is supposed that all parallel samples have a constant number of bits, or resolution, for the whole frame. If this does not happen, the bitstream cannot be serialized by these functions. As an example, this is the case of the RPE-LTP bitstream: the 260 bits of the encoded bitstream are not divided equally among the 76 parameters of the bitstream. In cases like this, users must write their own serialization function.

*Variables:*

_par_buf_:: Input buffer with right- or left-adjusted, parallel samples to be serialized.

_bit_stm_:: Output buffer with serial bitstream. It should be noted that _bit_stm_ must point to an appropriately allocated memory block, which should be a block of _n.resol_ `short`s if _sync_ is `0`, or a block of _(n+2).resol_ `short`s otherwise.

_n_:: Number of words in the input buffer, i.e., the number of parallel samples/frame.

_resol_:: Resolution (number of bits) of the samples in _par_buf_.

_sync_:: If 1, a synchronization header is to be used (appended) at the boundaries of each frame of the bitstream. If 0, a synchronization header is not used.

*Return value:*

This function returns the total number of softbits in the output bitstream, including the synchronization word and frame length. If the value returned is 0, the number of converted samples is zero.

==== `parallelize_*_justified`

*Syntax:*

[%unnumbered]

#include "ugst-utl.h"
long parallelize_right_justified (short _*bit_stm_, short _*par_buf_, long _bs_len_,
                                  long _resol_, char _sync_);
long parallelize_left_justified (short _*bit_stm_, short _*par_buf_, long _bs_len_,
                                 long _resol_, char _sync_);
----

*Prototype:* `ugst-utl.h`

*Description:*

Functions `parallelize_right_justified` and `parallelize_left_justified` convert the samples in input buffer _bit_stm_ from the ITU-T softbit representation to its parallel representation, given a number of bits per sample, or _resolution_. The input serial bitstream of length _bs_len_ is converted into a frame with _bs_len/resol_ samples (if _sync==0_) or _(bs_len--2)/resol_ samples (if _sync!=0_), with a resolution _resol_. It should be noted that softbits in lower positions in the input buffer are supposed to represent less significant bits of the parallel word (considering bits that would compose the same parallel word). In other words, the softbits that come first are less significant than the next ones, when referring to the same parallel word (as defined by the parameter _resol_). Therefore, when generating a word from the bitstream, bits from the bitstream that comes first are converted to lower significant bits. Frames with the synchronization flag but without the frame length cause the function to exit with an error code equal to _--bs_len_.

The difference between both functions is that `parallelize_right_justified` converts the serial bitstream to a parallel data in a right-justified format, i.e., data is aligned to the right, while the routine `parallelize_left_justified` parallelizes samples with left-justification.

If the G.192 Annex B bitstream format is used (parameter _sync==1_), a synchronization header is present at frame boundaries in the input buffer. In this case, the synchronization and frame length words are not copied from the bitstream to the output buffer.

Note that all parallel samples are supposed to have a constant number of bits, or resolution, for the whole frame. This means that, by construction, the number of softbits divided by the resolution must be an integer number, or _(bs_len--2)%resol==0_. If this does not happen, probably the serial bitstream was not generated by one of the `serialize_...()` routines, and cannot be parallelized by these functions. An example is the case of the RPE-LTP bitstream: the 260 bits of the encoded bitstream are not divided equally among the 76 parameters of the bitstream. In cases like this, users must write their own parallelization function.

If an erased frame is found, the function returns without performing
any action.

*Variables:*

_bit_stm_:: Input buffer with bitstream to be parallelized.

_par_buf_:: Output buffer with right- or left-adjusted samples.

_bs_len_:: Number of bits per frame (i.e., size of input buffer, which includes the synchronization header length if _sync==1_).

_resol_:: Resolution (number of bits per parallel sample) of the right- or left-adjusted samples in _par_buf_.

_sync_:: If 1, a synchronization header is expected in the boundaries of each frame of input the bitstream. If 0, synchronization headers are not expected.


*Return value:*

On success, this function returns the number of samples of the output
parallel sample buffer.

=== Portability and compliance

Since these tools do not refer to ITU-T Recommendations, no special compliance tests are needed. As for portability, it may be checked by running the same speech file on a proven platform and on a test platform. Files processed this way should match exactly. A preferred data file would be the ramp described in the compliance test description.

The routines in this module had portability tested for VAX/VMS with VAX-C and GNU C (gcc) and for MS-DOS with a number of Borland C/C++ compilers (Turbo C v2.0, Turbo-C++ v1.0, Borland C++ v3.1). Portability was also tested in a number of Unix workstations and compilers: Sun workstation with Sun-OS and Sun-C (cc), acc, and gcc; HP workstation with HP-UX and gcc.

=== Example code

==== Description of the demonstration programs

Two programs are provided as demonstration programs for the UTL module, `scaldemo.c` (version 1.3) and `spdemo.c` (version 3.2).

Program `scaldemo.c` scales a 16-bit, linear PCM input file by a user-specified linear or dB gain value. Default resolution is 16 bits per sample, and rounding is used by default when converting from float to short. When resolutions different from 16 bits are used with rounding, versions 1.2 and earlier of the program might not produce the "expected" results. The program used to limit the resolution of the samples (by masking the _16-resolution_ least significant bits) when converting from short to float. Additional rounding is applied after scaling when converting from float to short. If the desired operation is, actually, scale and then reduce the resolution with rounding, masking before the scaling operation should be disabled. In version 1.3 and later, the default behavior is *not* to apply such mask, (same as the option _-nopremask_) for backward compatible behavior, the option _-premask_ should be explicitly used.

Program `spdemo.c` converts files between serial and parallel formats using a user-specified resolution and frame (or block) size. A known issue with spdemonstration version 3.2 is that the command-line option -frame does not work properly for parallel-to-serial conversion. In this case, the desired frame size has to be specified as parameter stem:[N] in the command line.

==== The master header file for the STL demonstration programs

The module also contains the common demonstration program definition file `ugstdemo.h` (version 2.2), which is used by all STL demonstration programs. This header file contains the definition of a number of pseudo-functions and symbols that facilitate the use of a more homogeneous user interface for the different demonstration programs in the STL.

The available pseudo-functions include:

`GET_PAR_*`:: Pseudo-functions for printing a user prompt and reading a positional parameter from the command line. The parameters can be char \(C), integers (I), long integers (L), unsigned long integers (LU), floats (F), doubles (D), and strings (S).

`FIND_PAR_*`:: Pseudo-functions for printing a user prompt and reading a positional parameter from the command line if it was specified by the user, or to assume a default value defined by the programer. The parameters can be char (\C), integers (I), long integers (L), floats (F), doubles (D), and strings (S).

`ARGS()`:: The pseudo-function `ARGS()` allows that the list of parameters that show up as its arguments be passed on to ANSI-C compliant compilers, or be discarded for old-vintage, K&R-style compilers that do not accept parameter list in function prototypes. This pseudo-function allows for safer function prototypes in compilers that support parameter declaration in function prototypes and avoids the need to edit function declarations (or long `#if/#else/#end` for prototype sections) for non-ANSI C compilers.


Some of the symbols defined in `ugstdemo.h` include:

* Symbols `WB`, `RB`, `WT`, `RT`, and `RWT` for file open (`fopen()`) operation. These symbols are portable across a large number of platforms and permit write-binary, read-binary, write-text, read-text, and read-write-text file mode operations.
* Symbol `MSDOS`, which is necessary for proper compilation of some of the programs under the MS-DOS environment. The symbol is defined in case MS-DOS is detected, and undefined in case MS-DOS is not detected.
* Symbol `COMPILER`, which contains a text string describing the compiler used to generate an executable.


==== Short and float conversion and scaling routines

The following C code exemplifies the use of the short and float number format interchange routines, as well as of the gain scaling routine. This program is a simplified version of the example program `scaldemo.c` provided in the STL distribution. This program reads 16-bit, 2-complement, left-justified input samples, converts them to a float representation in the range of -1..+1, applies a gain (or loss) factor to these samples, converts the scaled samples back to an integer representation (16 bit, 2's complement, left-justified) using rounding and hard-clip of the floating-point numbers. The number of most significant bits to be used is also specified by the user.

==== Serialization and parallelization routines

The following C code implements an example of use of the serialization and parallelization routines available in the STL. Input data is generated within the program. The program takes the number of bits per sample, the justification, and whether synchronization headers should be generated. The input data is printed on the screen in its parallel representation, which is then converted to the serial format and back to the parallel format. Then, the serialized version of the data is printed on the screen, and the program ends.

== Unsupported tools

This Appendix to the ITU-T Software Tool Library (STL) Manual describes the unsupported tools provided in the ITU-T STL. The tools are named as "unsupported" because they do not follow the initial modularity concept of STL. These tools are provided "as is" and without any warranties or implied suitability to use. However, any feedback on problems with these tools will be welcome and accomodated as possible, as will any improvements made which can be shared and incorporated in the STL.
