The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is a permanent organ of ITU. ITU-T is responsible for studying technical, operating and tariff questions and issuing Recommendations on them with a view to standardizing telecommunications on a worldwide basis.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___06f59af6-f0ab-5af2-fd46-4e11f29b088c">The World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA), which meets every four years, establishes the topics for study by the ITU T study groups which, in turn, produce Recommendations on these topics.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___0f1c6d74-13b6-c31a-fd1e-9499f627b4ef">The approval of ITU-T Recommendations is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSA Resolution 1.</semantic__p>

<semantic__p id="semantic___0af791e0-9f42-316a-0bcf-cc393f69fe2b">In some areas of information technology which fall within ITU-T's purview, the necessary standards are prepared on a collaborative basis with ISO and IEC.</semantic__p>

However, the Recommendation may contain certain mandatory provisions (to ensure, e.g., interoperability or applicability) and compliance with the Recommendation is achieved when all of these mandatory provisions are met. The words "shall" or some other obligatory language such as "must" and the negative equivalents are used to express requirements. The use of such words does not suggest that compliance with the Recommendation is required of any party.</semantic__p>
