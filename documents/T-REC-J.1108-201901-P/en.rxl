Cable TV networks provide services by transmitting radio frequency (RF) signals between headend and cable modems (CM), the configuration and devices of cable TV networks are optimized for RF signal transmission. For the migration of all-fibre access cable TV networks, the existing network devices of service operators (SOs) providing broadcasting services and various data services through the hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) based cable TV network is recommended to change into the new network devices. Therefore, a cost-effective solution for deployable and acceptable migration toward an optic-based cable TV network is required.</p>

<p>Recommendation ITU-T J.1108 provides a cost-effective adaptable solution for HFC-based cable TV network devices in an optic-based cable TV network. The purpose of a radio over IP (RoIP) system is to transmit data over cable service interface specifications (DOCSIS) based up stream (US) RF signals of a cable modem (CM) to a cable modem termination system (CMTS) through IP transmission in optic-based cable TV networks.</p>
