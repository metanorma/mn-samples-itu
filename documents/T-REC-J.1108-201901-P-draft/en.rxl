Cable TV network provides services by transmitting RF signal between headend and Cable Modem (CM), the configuration and devices of cable TV network are optimized for RF signal transmission. For the migration of all-fiber access cable TV network, the existing network devices of Service Operators (SO) providing broadcasting services and various data services through the HFC-based cable TV network is recommended to change into the new network devices. Therefore, a cost-effective solution for deployable and acceptable migration toward optic-based cable TV network is required. This Draft [New] Recommendation provides a cost-effective adaptable solution for HFC-based cable TV network devices in optic-based cable TV network. The purpose of RoIP system is to transmit Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) based Up Stream (US) RF signal of Cable Modem (CM) to Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) through IP transmission in optic-based cable TV network.</p>
