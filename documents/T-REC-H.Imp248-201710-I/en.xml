<td valign="top" align="left"><p id="_6c76edc8-c337-2bf4-fc8d-c5e288b18b6b">Digit maps allow the specification of a "." DOT in a digit map. This DOT indicates that the preceding element may be repeated zero or more times.<br/>
The example in 7.1.14.9/[ITU-T H.248.1] shows its usage:<br/>
9011 + up to 15 digits is denoted by "9011x."<br/>
However there has been some confusion over whether the preceding element to the DOT has to be matched for a successful digit map completion. I.e. for the above example is "9011" a successful match?<br/>
This question has been posted to the IETF Megaco mailing list on two previous occasions previously: (29/09/2008, "Megaco question about interpretation of dot in a digitmap") and (16/05/2007, "DOT in H.248 Digit map syntax").<br/>
The reply on both those occasions was the key word is "repetitions" and that there must be at least occurrence of the preceding element. I.e. In the above example "90112" would result in a successful match but "9011" would not.</p>

<p id="_1ea0839f-a49d-4bd6-d195-46dd4a8bc2b9"><strong>7.1.14.3 DigitMap syntax</strong></p>

<p id="_64eeb2b6-364e-b3ae-9237-8c5d3499f81f">The formal syntax of the DigitMap is described by the DigitMap rule in the formal syntax description of the protocol (see Annexes A and B). A DigitMap, according to this syntax, is defined either by a string or by a list of strings. Each string in the list is an alternative event sequence, specified either as a sequence of DigitMap symbols or as a regular expression of DigitMap symbols. These DigitMap symbols, the digits "0" through "9" and letters "A" through a maximum value depending on the signalling system concerned, but never exceeding "K", correspond to specified events within a package which has been designated in the Events Descriptor on the termination to which the DigitMap is being applied. (The mapping between events and DigitMap symbols is defined in the documentation for packages associated with channel-associated signalling systems such as DTMF, MF, or R2. Digits "0" through "9" must be mapped to the corresponding digit events within the signalling system concerned. Letters should be allocated in logical fashion, facilitating the use of range notation for alternative events.)</p>

<p id="_d4668cc0-0a7b-2bb5-fa15-612146f0f781">The letter "x" is used as a wildcard, designating any event corresponding to symbols in the range "0"-"9". The string may also contain explicit ranges and, more generally, explicit sets of symbols, designating alternative events any one of which satisfies that position of the DigitMap. Finally, the dot symbol "." stands for <underline>one occurrence and</underline> zero or more repetitions of the event selector (event, range of events, set of alternative events, or wildcard) that precedes it. As a consequence of the third timing rule above, inter-event timing while matching a terminal dot symbol uses the short timer by default.</p>

<p id="_b561d129-85b6-2e42-72c1-bd929f3002e9">In addition to these event symbols, the string may contain "S" and "L" inter-event timing specifiers and the "Z" duration modifier. "S" and "L" respectively indicate that the MG should use the short (S) timer or the long (L) timer for subsequent events, overriding the timing rules described above. If an explicit timing specifier is in effect in one alternative event sequence, but none is given in any other candidate alternative, the timer value set by the explicit timing specifier must be used. If all sequences with explicit timing controls are dropped from the candidate set, timing reverts to the default rules given above. If used inside a range notation, the S and L specifiers shall be ignored. Finally, if conflicting timing specifiers are in effect in different alternative sequences, the long timer shall be used.</p>

<p id="_b794c727-3691-2509-28fb-e4fd8e1f860e">A "Z" designates a long duration event: placed in front of the symbol(s) designating the event(s) which satisfy a given digit position, it indicates that that position is satisfied only if the duration of the event exceeds the long-duration threshold. The value of this threshold is assumed to be provisioned in the MG, but, like the T, L, and S timers, can be overridden by specification within the DigitMap. If the Z specifier is not followed by a digit (0-9 or A-K), then the MG shall reject the digitmap as invalid procedure. When used in a range notation, the Z specifier applies solely to the immediately following digit. When used immediately prior to a range, the Z modifier applies to all digits in the range (thereby requiring a match in the range to be long duration).</p>

<li><p id="_4c817164-06c9-ffee-b703-21c40d09c2da"><strong>Mode Property (for directionality control)</strong><br/>
The allowed values for the Mode Property are "SendOnly", "RecvOnly", "SendRecv", "Inactive" and "LoopBack". "SendOnly", "RecvOnly" and "LoopBack" are with respect to the exterior of the context, so that, for example, a stream set to mode = "SendOnly" does not pass received media into the context. When a stream is set to "LoopBack" on a termination, media received (Local Descriptor) on the termination will be looped back to the sending side (Remote Descriptor) of the termination and no media is passed between that termination and other terminations in the context. The looped back media shall be sent according to the Remote Descriptor. The default value for the Mode Property is "Inactive". Signals and events are not affected by the Mode Property. Statistics may or may not be affected by the Mode property depending on the semantic of the statistic. For example: if the Mode was set to "SendOnly" and the Octet Received Statistic was set, then the statistic would not be affected. If the Octet Sent Statistic was set, then it would be affected by the mode. The LocalControl Mode Property takes precedence over any mode specified in the Local and Remote Descriptors. However, duplication and use of mode information in the SDP should be avoided. Due to the default of LocalControl Mode Property being "Inactive", if mode information was added to the Local and Remote Descriptor SDP and the LocalControl Mode was not explicitly sent, the effective mode would still be inactive.</p>

<p id="_7284308f-6bec-e279-7827-8947455f5a5a">This Recommendation allows a media gateway controller to request the media gateway to detect that after a certain period of time no Internet protocol application data has flowed on a particular termination/stream. The ability to detect if Internet protocol application data flow has stopped or has not started is useful to avoid dead lock in latching scenarios and also may be of use to detect hanging bearers.</p>

<p id="_8bbd2a28-616a-16b8-80f0-c7f498ca85e7">This Recommendation defines an event which is related to one or more IP 2-tuples[strike] . An individual 2-tuple is given by &lt;IP address, IP port&gt; of an IP flow of a H.248 stream or termination. The set of conditions for inactivity detection is related to IP packet arrival and/or departure events for all 2-tuples of a stream/termination. The condition of packet arrivals or departures respectively is controlled via a dedicated parameter (called "<em>direction</em>").</p>

<p id="_63fb7a67-a8a7-ae4d-be93-27f5073b636a"><underline>It has to be noted that there might be typically more detection conditions on top of the pure observation of "IP transport endpoint" (given by IP 2-tuple) activity. The entire detection conditions are effectively given by the stream/termination specific <em>lookup key</em> (clause 3.1.2/[ITU-T H.248.79]), which defines the particular packet-to/from-Context delivery process, according clause 6/[ITU-T H.248.79]. Appendix IV provides some examples for traffic components which would match (or not) such lookup keys.</underline></p>

<td valign="top" align="left"><p id="_f90422c9-6020-c67b-1d6d-da2caa242243">H.248.53 does not specifically discuss relevant traffic components of an IP flow as part (or not) of traffic policy, e.g. when considering IP bearer traffic policing (clause 9.4/H.248.53 and applied packages from clauses 7 and 8).<br/>
Following basic issue was observed: A single or multiple IP flow(s) associated to an H.248 stream/termination could be basically divided in two IP traffic portions:<br/>
IP application data traffic related to the communication application itself, i.e., with end-to-end significance; and<br/>
IP-based control traffic along the bearer path, with purpose of NAT traversal, authentication procedures, bearer control protocol for (segmented) IP transport connections (e.g., TCP segment), bearer control protocol for (segmented) IP security sessions, etc., i.e., without end-to-end significance (rather type hop-to-hop).<br/>
Both traffic portions provide following difference from H.248 Context point of view: the e2e traffic (1) is going through the Context, and traffic (2) is terminated by a SEP.<br/>
That's an important distinction concerning traffic policing, which has originally only e2e traffic (1) in scope, but not (2) (in our understanding).</p>

<p id="_c612da71-ac17-ad56-0485-97e38e4d0d4b"><strong>1 Scope</strong></p>

<p id="_d4af7c6d-18ad-494f-b68c-47e910692c69">There has been a trend towards virtualized or cloud-based networks where a physical device or network hosts several virtual instances meeting the needs of different customers. Different service models exist, usually utilizing the terminology "x – as a service (xASS)", e.g., platform as a service (PAAS) and infrastructure as a service (IAAS).</p>

<p id="_54d34e1b-5658-a335-0e7d-9fcede271edf">A common aspect of the different cloud service models is that a certain set of resources is allocated (via an operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) system) based on a set of customer requirements. These requirements may detail the applications, libraries, data, memory, processing resources, storage, and associated configuration settings.</p>

<p id="_6dbd49b3-83a1-1b4e-071e-878c68bf3b01">One of the main concepts of ITU-T H.248 is the use of the virtual media gateway (VMG). This allows multiple VMG instances per physical media gateway (MG). Each VMG is treated as a separate MG instance and thus has its own control association and set of resources, configurations, etc. Thus, it has similarities to cloud virtualization concepts.</p>

<p id="_11597075-6d34-4daa-4d58-0b51e3cef61f">ITU-T H.248 is largely silent on provisioning resources for VMGs, apart from clause 11.1 of [ITU-T H.248.1], which states that the mechanism for allocating terminations to VMGs is a management method outside the scope of [ITU-T H.248.1]. Whilst the provisioning of terminations is out of the scope of ITU-T H.248, it does have the "ITU-T H.248 Profile" concept. Profiles specify what options associated with [ITU-T H.248.1] have been used. Appendix III of [ITU-T H.248.1] provides an example profile template showing the information that can be derived from the profile ID. ITU-T H.248 profiles, when used by a virtual media gateway (VMG), indicate what ITU-T H.248 elements can be used. Profiles have been defined by several standards development organizations (e.g., 3GPP, ETSI TISPAN, MSF) and several vendors to define the ITU-T H.248 functionality of certain interfaces.</p>

<p id="_240ff266-01d0-c36d-40b4-f455a7a54274">ITU-T H.248 provides an abstraction model for an MGC to access and control physical resources on an MG without having to address these physical resources. The concepts of Contexts, Terminations, Streams and Descriptors are used. Whilst terminations are typically statically provisioned, the underlying resources may be statically or dynamically allocated between the VMGs. The physical resources may relate to the central processing unit (CPU), digital signal processor (DSP), memory, storage, or power use. So whilst the ITU-T H.248 options defined by an ITU-T H.248 Profile are related to these resources, there is not a one–to-one mapping due to the abstraction layer. Some form of provisioning is required to assign the physical resources to a VMG instance.</p>

<p id="_4cb8cb1d-5ad9-5d7e-0728-e6747351c224">ITU-T H.248 allows an MG and MGC to negotiate the use of a certain profile (functionality set) via the use of the <em>ServiceChangeProfile</em> parameter (see clause 7.2.8.1.5 of [ITU-T H.248.1]). An example profile is the <em>Mc</em> <underline>reference point</underline> <strike><em>n</em> interface</strike> (profile name: <em>threegbicsn</em>) defined by [b-3GPP TS 29.232]. However, this does not identify a particular resource profile. The MGC cannot deduce from the profile name how resources are provisioned on the (V)MG. The set of provisioned resources could be tied to the media gateway identity (ITU-T H.248 Mid) but this unnecessarily ties the transport network configuration to the MG hardware configuration. Many ITU-T H.248 packages specify a default of "provisioned" for the elements defined by the package. It is assumed that these are co-ordinated via other provisioning means (e.g., SNMP MIBs). As an ITU-T H.248 MG can be provisioned with different sets of resources per ITU-T H.248 Profile Name and/or Mid another form of correlation identity between the MGC and MG to coordinate what has been provisioned is required.</p>

<p id="_12ee4fca-3642-e31a-01b1-34de93191fe0">This Recommendation defines functionality that allows an MG to indicate to an MGC what media gateway instance is in use. It also allows an MGC to audit an MG to determine the MG instance in use. This Recommendation utilises a ServiceChangeExtension parameter that allows the MG instance to be reported during an initial ServiceChange command exchange. An ITU-T H.248 package is defined to allow an MGC to audit packages to determine if the MG instance functionality is supported. It also allows the auditing of a root Termination property to determine the MG instance.</p>

This allows implementations of ITU-T H.323 gateways to be highly scalable and encourages leverage of widely deployed Switched Circuit Network (SCN) capabilities such as SS7 switches. This also enables ITU-T H.323 gateways to be composed of components from multiple vendors distributed across multiple physical platforms. The purpose of this Recommendation is to add capabilities currently defined for ITU-T H.323 systems and is intended to provide new ways of performing operations already supported in ITU-T H.323.This revision contains a number of clarifications on:</abstract>  <status>    <stage>Published</stage>  </status>  <copyright>    <from>2013</from>    <owner>      <organization>

Such types of bearer connections could be subject of traffic control mechanisms. Recommendation ITU-T H.248.53 provides three H.248 packages addressing traffic management, traffic policing and packet size control. This Recommendation focuses on the traffic policing function.This revision contains an update to the traffic policing statistics package. The update adds new statistic elements and expands these package's procedures allowing the reporting of finer‑grained information regarding any violations of the policing parameters.</abstract>      <status>        <stage>Published</stage>      </status>      <copyright>        <from>2009</from>        <owner>          <organization>

The syntactic packages provide the ability to specify announcements with variable content, with a degree of flexibility constrained only by the provisioning of the MG and MGC. This syntax may in principle be used to specify multimedia announcements, although its application in this Recommendation is to evoke audio content. The functional packages provide advanced control of an Audio Resource Function using the ITU-T H.248.1 protocol. The packages provide the ability to play recorded announcements with variable content, carry out prompted collection of digits, and carry out prompted collection of recorded audio. An additional package provides the ability to manage recorded media segments on the media gateway.Additional functionality incorporated by ITU-T H.248.9 (2005) Amendment 1 (2007):ITU-T H.248.9 (2005) Amendment 1 (2007) defines packages which enable automatic speech recognition (ASR), text to speech (TTS) and multimedia playout functionality between a media gateway controller (MGC) and a media gateway (MG) controlled by ITU-T H.248.1. In this scenario, the MGC may take the form of a media controller (MC) and the MG may take the form of a media processor (MP).This revision introduces a number of new functions. The new functions include:</abstract>      <status>        <stage>Published</stage>      </status>      <copyright>        <from>2009</from>        <owner>          <organization>
