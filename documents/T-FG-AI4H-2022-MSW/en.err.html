&lt;p id=&quot;_11f86dc3-646d-3519-0d94-13cb4395b77a&quot;&gt;Several important changes imposed by the use of AI in clinical care extend beyond the provider-patient relationship. Four trends described here are: the evolving role of the patient in clinical care; the shift from hospital to home-based care; use of AI to provide &quot;clinical&quot; care outside the formal health system; and use of AI for resource allocation and prioritization. Each of these trends has ethical implications, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_a3d12e4b-ba68-e011-f984-d2068bb43268&quot;&gt;Several AI tools for population and public health can be used in public health programmes. For example, new developments in AI could, after rigorous evaluation, improve identification of disease outbreaks and support surveillance. Several concerns about the use of technology for public health surveillance, promotion and outbreak response must, however, be considered before use of AI for such purposes, including the tension between the public health benefits of surveillance and ethical and legal concern about individual (or community) privacy and autonomy  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;who-guide&quot; citeas=&quot;[276]&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_5dbd0768-ce3a-440f-171a-de8f353ae379&quot;&gt;The Recommendations of the OECD Council on Artificial Intelligence &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;oecd-legal&quot; citeas=&quot;[316]&quot;/&gt;, the first intergovernmental standard on AI, were adopted in May 2019 by OECD&apos;s 36 member countries and have since been applied by a number of partner economies. The OECD AI principles  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;going-digital&quot; citeas=&quot;[317]&quot;/&gt; provided the basis for the AI principles endorsed by G20 governments in June 2019  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;eee-digital&quot; citeas=&quot;[318]&quot;/&gt;. While OECD recommendations are not legally binding, they carry a political commitment and have proved highly influential in setting international standards in other policy areas (e.g., privacy and data protection) and helping governments to design national legislation. The OECD launched an online platform for public policy on AI, the AI Policy Observatory &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;oecd-ai&quot; citeas=&quot;[319]&quot;/&gt; (See &lt;xref target=&quot;sec-9-6&quot;/&gt;.) and is cooperating on this and other initiatives on the ethical implications of AI with the Council of Europe, the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and WHO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_1b93e0e7-967a-2515-be43-f6d3fba0e758&quot;&gt;Ethical principles for the application of AI for health and other domains are intended to guide developers, users and regulators in improving and overseeing the design and use of such technologies. Human dignity and the inherent worth of humans are the central values upon which all other ethical principles rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_dc59c1b7-5f58-8b11-52ea-0c36bb48d408&quot;&gt;An ethical principle is a statement of a duty or a responsibility in the context of the development, deployment and continuing assessment of AI technologies for health.

&lt;p id=&quot;_15fbf04c-7b6b-7e2e-935c-a569fa129be2&quot;&gt;Several ethical challenges are emerging with the use of AI for health, many of which are especially relevant to LMIC. These challenges must be addressed if AI technologies are to support achievement of universal health coverage. Use of AI to extend health-care coverage and services in marginalized communities in HIC can raise similar ethical concerns, including an enduring digital divide, lack of good-quality data, collection of data that incorporate clinical biases (as well as inappropriate data collection practices) and lack of treatment options after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_089cb2b2-758a-364d-18e5-4d21aacdd8ce&quot;&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic is expanding and accelerating the creation of infrastructure for digital identities to store health data for several uses. In China, a QR code system has been established from the digital payment system established by Alipay, a mobile and online payment platform, to introduce an &quot;Alipay Health Code&quot;, in which the data collected are used to establish an algorithm to &quot;draw automated conclusions as to whether someone is a contagion risk&quot;  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;mozur&quot; citeas=&quot;[21]&quot;/&gt;. For a national programme to vaccinate millions of people against SARS-Cov2, India may use its national digital ID system, Aadhar, to avoid duplication and to track beneficiaries  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;angwadi&quot; citeas=&quot;[23]&quot;/&gt;. Many entities around the world, including travel firms, airports, some governments and political leaders, as well as the digital ID industry, are calling for the introduction of immunity passports or a digital &quot;credential given to a person who is assumed to be immune from SARS-CoV2 and so protected against re-infection&quot; &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;immunity-pass&quot; citeas=&quot;[24]&quot;/&gt;. In some countries, technologies such as proximity-tracking applications have been credited with improving the response to the pandemic, because there was already a system in place to support the use of such technologies, effective communication, widespread adoption and a &quot;social compact&quot; between policy-makers and the public  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;fisherm&quot; citeas=&quot;[25]&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_ef162a48-d7a5-d2fc-e017-8d7b0f8d0486&quot;&gt;For many of these technologies, however, there is concern about whether they are effective (scientifically valid), whether they will create forms of discrimination or targeting of certain populations and whether they may exclude certain segments of the population or not be applicable by people who do not have access to the appropriate technology and infrastructure. They also raise concern about the generation of a permanent digital identity for individuals linked to their health and personal data, for which they may not have given consent, which could permanently undermine individual autonomy and privacy  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;looming-disaster&quot; citeas=&quot;[26]&quot;/&gt;.

&lt;p id=&quot;_0dd31783-5a28-3570-39bc-bf4a1a834393&quot;&gt;Google announced a strategic partnership with the University of Chicago and the University of Chicago Medicine in the USA in May 2017  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;wood&quot; citeas=&quot;[34]&quot;/&gt;. The aim of the partnership was to develop novel machine-learning tools to predict medical events such as unexpected hospital admissions. To realize this goal, the University shared hundreds of thousands of &quot;de-identified&quot; patients&apos; records with Google. One of the University&apos;s patients, Matt Dinerstein, filed a class action complaint against the University and Google in June 2019 on behalf of all patients whose records were disclosed  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;shachar&quot; citeas=&quot;[35]&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_4e8a874b-f726-30dd-2ee3-f6d23839ccde&quot;&gt;Dinerstein brought several claims, including breach of contract, against the University and Google, alleging prima facie violation of the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. According to an article published in 2018 by the defendants  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;rajkomar&quot; citeas=&quot;[36]&quot;/&gt;, the patients&apos; medical records shared with Google &quot;were de-identified, except that dates of service were maintained in the (…​) dataset&quot;. The dataset also included &quot;free-text medical notes&quot;  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;rajkomar&quot; citeas=&quot;[36]&quot;/&gt;. Dinerstein accused the defendants of insufficient anonymization of the records, putting the patients&apos; privacy at risk. He alleged that the patients could easily be re-identified by Google by combining the records with other available data sets, such as geolocation data from Google Maps (by so-called &quot;data triangulation&quot;). Moreover, Dinerstein asserted that the University had not obtained express consent from each patient to share their medical records with Google, despite the technology giant&apos;s commercial interest in the data.&lt;/p&gt;</pre></td><td>2</td></tr>

&lt;title&gt;Accountability and responsibility for decision-making with artificial intelligence&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;_bf69aa59-baa4-d434-8ffa-9bd57aabeaf9&quot;&gt;This section addresses the challenges of assigning responsibility and accountability for the use of AI for health care, a guiding principle noted in  &lt;xref target=&quot;sec-5&quot;/&gt;. Much of the momentum of AI is based on the notion that use of such technologies for diagnosis, care or systems could improve clinical and institutional decision-making for health care. Clinicians and health-care workers have numerous cognitive biases and commit diagnostic errors. The US National Academy of Sciences found that 5% of US adults who seek health advice receive erroneous diagnoses and that such errors account for 10% of all patient deaths  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;grote&quot; citeas=&quot;[54]&quot;/&gt;. At the institutional level, machine learning might reduce inefficiency and errors and ensure more appropriate allocation of resources, if the underlying data are both accurate and representative  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;grote&quot; citeas=&quot;[54]&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_5d2e1a6f-9629-1c6e-3f3c-0da9b225ed11&quot;&gt;AI-guided decision-making also introduces several trade-offs and risks. One set of trade-offs is associated with the displacement of human judgement and control and concern about using AI to predict a person&apos;s health status or the evolution of disease. This is a major ethical and epistemological challenge to humans as the centre of production of knowledge and also to the system of production of knowledge for medicine. These considerations are addressed in  &lt;xref target=&quot;sec-6-5&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</pre></td><td>2</td></tr>

&lt;p id=&quot;_40630da1-df9c-42c4-a380-99857b50a250&quot;&gt;Decision-making has not yet been &quot;fully transferred&quot; from humans to machines in health care. While AI is used only to augment human decision-making in the practice of public health and medicine, epistemic authority has, in some circumstances, been displaced, whereby AI systems (such as with the use of computer simulations) are displacing humans from the centre of knowledge production ( &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;duran&quot; citeas=&quot;[68]&quot;/&gt;, &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;humphreys&quot; citeas=&quot;[69]&quot;/&gt;). Furthermore, there are signs of full delegation of routine medical functions to AI. Delegation of clinical judgement introduces concern about whether full delegation is legal, as laws increasingly recognize the right of individuals not to be subject to solely automated decisions when such decisions would have a significant effect. Full delegation also creates a risk of automation bias on the part of the provider, as discussed above. Other concerns could emerge if human judgement is increasingly replaced by machine-guided judgement, and wider ethical concern would arise with loss of human control, especially if prediction-based health care becomes the norm. Yet, as for autonomous cars, it is unlikely that AI in medicine will ever achieve full autonomy. It may achieve only conditional automation or require human back-up  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;topol&quot; citeas=&quot;[70]&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_fca18c2d-ade8-fdae-761b-1be1f08d35c2&quot;&gt;Consider use of an AI in a hospital to make recommendations on a drug and dosage for a patient. The AI recommends a particular drug and dosage for patient A. The physician does not, however, understand how the AI reached its recommendation. The AI has a highly sophisticated algorithm and is thus a black box for the physician. Should the physician follow the AI&apos;s recommendation? If patients were to find out that an AI or machine-learning system was used to recommend their care but no one had told them, how would they feel? Does the physician have a moral or even a legal duty to tell patient A that he or she has consulted an AI technology? If so, what essential information should the physician provide to patient A? Should disclosure of the use of AI be part of obtaining informed consent and should a lack of sufficient information incur liability? &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;cohen&quot; citeas=&quot;[74]&quot;/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_352130b9-0e30-6f09-3411-7ed1d4b53974&quot;&gt;Transparency is crucial to promoting trust among all stakeholders, particularly patients. Physicians should be frank with patients from the onset and inform them of the use of AI rather than hiding the technology. They should try their best to explain to their patients the purpose of using AI, how it functions and whether it is explainable. They should describe what data are collected, how they are used and shared with third parties and the safeguards for protection of patients&apos; privacy. Physicians should also be transparent about any weaknesses of the AI technology, such as any biases, data breaches or privacy concerns. Only with transparency can the deployment of AI for health care and health science, including hospital practice and clinical trials  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;minssen&quot; citeas=&quot;[75]&quot;/&gt;, become a long-term success.

&lt;p id=&quot;_0c1755ed-98c2-0395-a475-265c7e763831&quot;&gt;In a study published in Science in October 2019 &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;obermeyer&quot; citeas=&quot;[101]&quot;/&gt;, researchers found significant racial bias in an algorithm used widely in the US health-care system to guide health decisions. The algorithm is based on cost (rather than illness) as a proxy for needs; however, the US health-care system spent less money on Black than on white patients with the same level of need. Thus, the algorithm incorrectly assumed that white patients were sicker than equally sick Black patients. The researchers estimated that the racial bias reduced the number of Black patients receiving extra care by more than half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_ad9b3fa9-3eaa-596d-fba5-8a2b4d3ad695&quot;&gt;This case highlights the importance of awareness of biases in AI and mitigating them from the onset to prevent discrimination (based on, e.g., race, gender, age or disability). Biases may be present not only in the algorithm but also, for example, in the data used to train the algorithm. Many other types of bias, such as contextual bias ( &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;prince-wn&quot; citeas=&quot;[102]&quot;/&gt;, &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;minssen-regulatory&quot; citeas=&quot;[103]&quot;/&gt;), should be considered.

&lt;p id=&quot;_265e5c8d-1c49-deac-5243-d3ea4407c485&quot;&gt;Machine learning has outperformed dermatologists in detecting potentially cancerous skin lesions. As rates of skin cancer increase in many countries, AI technology would improve the ability of dermatologists to diagnose skin cancer. The data used to train one highly accurate machine-learning model are, however, for &quot;fair-skinned&quot; populations in Australia, Europe and the USA. Thus, while the technology assists in diagnosis, prevention and treatment of skin cancer in white and light-skinned individuals, the algorithm was neither appropriate nor relevant for people of colour, as it was not trained on images of these populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_3af69ea1-7f77-f1ee-c276-2f2e5af7b692&quot;&gt;Although technology designers and developers play critical roles in designing AI tools for use in health, there are no procedures for credentialing or licensing such as those required for health-care workers.

&lt;p id=&quot;_fe30a736-c5c5-f6df-f546-9f37e660ca03&quot;&gt;&quot;Design for values&quot; is explicit transposition of moral and social values into context-dependent design requirements. It is an umbrella term for several pioneering methods, such as value-sensitive design, values in design and participatory design. Design for values presents a roadmap for stakeholders to translate human rights into context-dependent design requirements through a structured, inclusive, transparent process, such that abstract values are translated into design requirements and norms (properties that a technology should have to ensure certain values), and the norms then become a socio-technical design requirement. The process of identifying design requirements permits all stakeholders, including individuals affected by the technology, users, engineers, field experts and legal practitioners, to debate design choices and identify the advantages and shortcomings of each choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_537c2ce8-4d38-de1d-1e4c-44c1444d70c6&quot;&gt;Thus, a value such as privacy can be interpreted through certain norms, such as informed consent, right to erasure and confidentiality. These norms can then be converted by discussion and consultation into design requirements, such as positive opt-in (a means of ensuring informed consent) or homomorphic encryption techniques to assure confidentiality. Other techniques for safeguarding privacy, such as &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-anonymity, differential privacy and coarse graining through clustering, could also be selected through consultation.&lt;/p&gt;</pre></td><td>2</td></tr>

&lt;p id=&quot;_9e2a3de8-e440-913e-b843-85cc05888665&quot;&gt;Physicians and nurses will also require a wider range of competence to apply AI in clinical practice, including better understanding of mathematical concepts, the fundamentals of AI, data science, health data provenance, curation, integration and governance  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;topol-preparing&quot; citeas=&quot;[166]&quot;/&gt;, and also of the ethical and legal issues associated with the use of AI for health. Such measures (including training) will be necessary to combine and analyse data from many sources adequately, supervise AI tools and detect inaccurate performance of AI  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;paranjape&quot; citeas=&quot;[160]&quot;/&gt;. Good support and training will ensure that health-care workers and physicians, for example, can avoid common pitfalls such as automation bias when using AI technologies. Eventually, the knowledge, skills and capabilities required of health workers may be defined by professional and statutory regulatory bodies in collaboration with practitioners and educators  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;topol-preparing&quot; citeas=&quot;[166]&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</pre></td><td>2</td></tr>

&lt;title&gt;Liability regimes for artificial intelligence for health&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;_61ac45b0-1ea0-cd4f-b38c-150f34eb4262&quot;&gt;Although the performance of machine-learning algorithms is improving, there will still be errors and mistakes, for example because an algorithm has been trained with incomplete or inappropriate data, programming mistakes or security flaws. Even AI technologies designed with well-curated data and an appropriate algorithm could harm an individual. While AI technologies may be safe in practice, unforeseeable risks are likely  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;rahwan&quot; citeas=&quot;[170]&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_9226f37f-de17-f51b-ef53-ea513df1548e&quot;&gt;Lawmakers and regulators should ensure that rules and frameworks for safety are applicable to the use of AI technologies for health care and that they are proactively integrated into the design and deployment of AI-guided technologies. Updated liability rules for the use of AI in clinical care and medicine should at least include the same standards and damages already applied to health care. It is possible that reliance on AI technologies and the risks they may pose require additional obligations and damages. This section addresses how liability regimes could evolve, approaches to compensation, specific considerations for LMIC and the role of international institutions and organizations. It does not address liability that may arise from data processing.&lt;/p&gt;</pre></td><td>2</td></tr>

&lt;p id=&quot;_98b20ba3-9828-12d5-8dcb-14deabe6607a&quot;&gt;Human rights standards, data protection laws and ethical principles are all necessary to guide, regulate and manage the use of AI for health by developers, governments, providers and patients. Many stakeholders have called for a commonly accepted set of ethical principles for AI for health, and WHO hopes that the principles suggested in this document (See  &lt;xref target=&quot;sec-5&quot;/&gt;.) will encourage consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_e3397d39-4dbf-cdf8-322c-952160ac6106&quot;&gt;Use of AI for health introduces several challenges that cannot be resolved by ethical principles and existing laws and policies, in particular because the risks and opportunities of the use of AI are not yet well understood or will change over time. Furthermore, many principles, laws and standards were devised by and for HIC. LMIC will face additional challenges to introducing new AI technologies, which will require not only awareness of and adherence to ethical principles but also appropriate governance.&lt;/p&gt;</pre></td><td>2</td></tr>

&lt;p id=&quot;_35ef97ba-d75d-ab20-9363-9073bfee086c&quot;&gt;The definition of &quot;health data&quot; has widened dramatically over the past two decades. Successful development of an AI system for use in health care relies on high-quality data, which are used to both train and validate the algorithmic model. This section addresses the evolution of individual consent with the proliferation of health data as well as the principles, legal frameworks and measures used by governments. This section also addresses principles and mechanisms designed and used to govern health data by communities, academic or health-care institutions, companies or governments, including how these entities should share health data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_a70b971d-023f-f882-e457-87f490c10607&quot;&gt;The application of big data and AI for health care raises questions about how to assess and govern data control, IP and other proprietary and privacy rights that might affect the use and control of medical data and AI-driven technologies. These include asserting exclusive rights over health datasets, algorithms, software and products that include AI and the outcomes of AI-based technologies, such as medicines and diagnostic technologies. Several wider questions should be resolved, including whether health big data can or should be controlled exclusively by individuals by an appropriate form of governance or by entities that may aggregate the data. (Control of personal data is discussed above.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_8bfe5716-6662-6db3-c5f6-ce593c7143a5&quot;&gt;A separate question is whether novel products created solely by a machine can be &quot;owned&quot; and, if so, whether ownership rights are conferred on the machine or on the entity that created or controls the machine. There is also the question of assigning appropriate value to the public&apos;s contribution to development of new AI technologies, such as investment in the development of algorithms, provision of data by individuals and health systems and from health data hubs accessed by private actors for the development of new AI technologies. If AI technologies are increasingly protected by exclusive rights, there is the wider question of whether they will be available, appropriate and affordable in LMIC.&lt;/p&gt;</pre></td><td>2</td></tr>

&lt;p id=&quot;_7a926020-fe1c-5ddf-4ffd-7dca498940f1&quot;&gt;The private sector plays a central role in the development and delivery of AI for health care. The &quot;private sector&quot; ranges from small start-ups to the world&apos;s largest technology companies, as well as companies that provide many of the materials necessary for AI, including health data collected by companies that supply wearable devices, data aggregators and software firms that write new algorithms for use in health care. Furthermore, many companies that were already providing products and services are transforming their businesses to integrate AI and big data. These include biopharmaceutical companies, diagnostic and medical device firms, insurance companies, private hospitals and health-care providers. Companies that are developing AI technologies for use in health care are also providing these applications and services outside the health-care system, raising the question of how such health-care provision should be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_8fd51868-da48-6eb1-662d-0c9d3b101344&quot;&gt;This section addresses several issues related to the governance of such companies: To what extent should oversight and governance of the private sector be enforced by companies collectively or individually? What challenges and opportunities for effective governance are associated with PPPs for AI for health care? What are the challenges of oversight and governance of large technology companies involved in the use of AI for health? How should governments manage the growth of health-care services provided by companies outside the health system? How can governments ensure that they are effectively overseeing the private sector?&lt;/p&gt;</pre></td><td>2</td></tr>

&lt;p id=&quot;_3162e0f2-bf98-b588-9bb0-3787edec8b65&quot;&gt;Use of AI in the public sector has increased recently, although it lags behind adoption by the private sector. In 2019, OECD identified 50 countries that have launched or are planning to launch national AI strategies, of which 36 plan to or have issued separate strategies for public sector AI  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;hello-world&quot; citeas=&quot;[245]&quot;/&gt;. In 2017, the United Arab Emirates was the first country in the world to have a designated minister for AI, which has resulted in increased use of AI in the health-care system, such as &quot;pods&quot; to detect early signs of illness, AI-enabled telemedicine and use of AI to detect diabetic retinopathy  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;ai-uae&quot; citeas=&quot;[246]&quot;/&gt;. Although use of AI has increased in the public sector, a review of nearly 1700 studies found only 59 on use of AI in the public sector  &lt;eref type=&quot;inline&quot; bibitemid=&quot;hello-world&quot; citeas=&quot;[245]&quot;/&gt;. There is no comprehensive account of how governments are advancing the use of AI or integrating it into health care. The OECD identified six broad roles for governments in AI, as a:&lt;/p&gt;

A WHO working group has been formed to address regulatory considerations for the use of AI for health care and drug development and will issue a report and recommendations in 2021. The present guidance identifies several ethical concerns that could be addressed by regulatory agencies and the challenges that could arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;_602005e6-e368-e6e5-1ca4-190ebc267c0a&quot;&gt;The following considerations are intended for ministries of health, which will have the primary responsibility for determining whether and how AI technologies should be integrated into health systems, the conditions under which they should be used, the protection of individuals that must accompany use of such technologies and policies that can address both expected and unexpected ethical challenges. Evaluation, regulation, deployment and oversight of AI technologies will require inter-ministerial coordination. Thus, while these considerations are directed to ministries of health, implementation will require collaboration with other relevant ministries, such as of information technology and education.&lt;/p&gt;

While programmers may be those primarily responsible for the design of AI technologies and ministries of health and regulatory agencies for approval and selection of such technologies for use, health-care providers determine which technologies to use and how and may also provide direct feedback to the health-care system, the medical community and the designers of the technologies about whether they meet the needs of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

Use of AI technologies for health outside regular health-care settings is discussed in  &lt;xref target=&quot;sec-3-1&quot;/&gt; of this document. Three areas are considered: whether the AI technology is necessary and appropriate; whether the context in which the AI technology will be used is appropriate; and whether a health-care provider should use a particular AI technology.&lt;/p&gt;</pre></td><td>2</td></tr>
