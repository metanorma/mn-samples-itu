<title>FOREWORD</title>
<p id="_e39b916a-1911-02cf-fce1-6e2bbef3a82b">The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the United Nations specialized agency in the field of telecommunications , information and communication technologies (ICTs). The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is a permanent organ of ITU. ITU-T is responsible for studying technical, operating and tariff questions and issuing Recommendations on them with a view to standardizing telecommunications on a worldwide basis.</p>

<p id="_06f59af6-f0ab-5af2-fd46-4e11f29b088c">The World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA), which meets every four years, establishes the topics for study by the ITU T study groups which, in turn, produce Recommendations on these topics.</p>

<p id="_0f1c6d74-13b6-c31a-fd1e-9499f627b4ef">The approval of ITU-T Recommendations is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSA Resolution 1.</p>

<p id="_0af791e0-9f42-316a-0bcf-cc393f69fe2b">In some areas of information technology which fall within ITU-T's purview, the necessary standards are prepared on a collaborative basis with ISO and IEC.</p>

<p id="_56570421-b373-1413-9648-1e440630df94">In this Recommendation, the expression "Administration" is used for conciseness to indicate both a telecommunication administration and a recognized operating agency.</p>

<p id="_80edab97-2dbf-d0cc-086a-539f4730432e">Compliance with this Recommendation is voluntary. However, the Recommendation may contain certain mandatory provisions (to ensure, e.g., interoperability or applicability) and compliance with the Recommendation is achieved when all of these mandatory provisions are met. The words "shall" or some other obligatory language such as "must" and the negative equivalents are used to express requirements. The use of such words does not suggest that compliance with the Recommendation is required of any party.</p>

<p id="_adc519f1-c0c9-7256-9549-8636ddd55cfc">TSAG agreed at its February 2011 meeting to update the author's guide (last revised 14 March 2007) based upon <link target="http://www.itu.int/md/T09-TSAG-C-0041/en">C41</link> and the related discussion of that meeting. The convener of the ad hoc group on working methods, together with TSB, was tasked with preparing a final text. That text appears on subsequent pages.</p>

<p id="_c8a692de-d7fa-c117-4a1c-a9415c4bc9af">Subsequently, TSAG agreed at its February 2016 meeting to make mandatory the Keywords field based on <link target="http://www.itu.int/md/T13-TSAG-160201-TD-GEN-0405/en">TD405</link>.

<p id="_774c88af-3c1f-aff1-aeb7-2bfdad43fdfc">This author's guide is intended to provide a common approach to the preparation of ITU-T texts that are intended for publication, e.g., draft Recommendations. It attempts to cover the kind of questions likely to arise in the preparation of an ITU-T Recommendation and provides, through application of its own rules, an illustration using the normal order of the elements of drafting a typical Recommendation. To avoid confusion which may result from this approach for a first-time reader, detailed explanations of the contents of each heading are given in <xref target="Description_of_introductory_material_to_be_provided_by_the_author"/> and <xref target="Description_of_core_material"/> below.</p>

<p id="_e8d472db-2499-4a0c-4a1f-cd139892f65e">Lists allow associated short clauses to be presented outside of the main paragraph numbering scheme thus avoiding excessively long clause numbers (e.g., 2.13.3.3.2 is equivalent to point two of the third indent of clause 2.13.3). In the interest of simplicity, authors should avoid lists with more than three levels.</p>

<title>Equations and formulae</title>
<p id="_64e893b2-12c2-a1c3-ab74-c69270f6b9e0">Equations and formulae shall be in the mathematically correct form and shall occupy one or more lines with no text, unless text is an integral part of the expression. ITU formats all equations and formulae by means of MathType; to avoid transcription errors within ITU during publication, the use of this tool by the authors is encouraged.</p>

<p id="_78aae3ee-b064-7cf8-398b-b6cb8af57e8b">When necessary, equations should be given a number (placed between parentheses at the right margin of the page) that contains the main clause number plus a number in Arabic numerals in sequence from the beginning of this clause. For example, Equation 6-3 is the third mathematical expression in clause 6 of the Recommendation in which it is contained. Given the complicated nature of mathematical expressions, great care shall be exercised to ensure the clarity of manuscripts (e.g., for the vertical placement of subscripted or superscripted numbers or variables).</p>

<p id="_f4a37b4e-bd37-053d-f4f8-6aa83d5f0c75">In order to avoid ambiguity, it is recommended to use a single quote (') as a thousand's digit separator instead of spaces, commas or dots (e.g., "1'000'000").</p>

<p id="_f2718003-b3da-3d75-c399-6dd218a75fe9">Arabic numerals and non-Latin characters (e.g., Greek, Cyrillic) should not be in italic typeface.</p>

<title>Figures</title>
<p id="_d7d0b296-7049-d583-78a7-dba9db7c6ee4">Figures shall be numbered with Arabic numerals, beginning with 1 (within annexes or appendices, there will be a letter-plus-period or a Roman-numeral-plus-period prefix). This numbering shall normally be independent from the numbering of the clause and of any tables. For Recommendations which are very long or complex, however, the author may number figures sequentially with respect to the single digit clause number. For example, Figure 4-3 denotes the third figure in clause 4 of the Recommendation in which it is contained.</p>

<p id="_5255f3c9-924c-3ec4-78a8-417859b7b543">The number and title shall be placed on the same line and centred, below the figure. The first letter of the title shall be capitalized; all other words shall not be capitalized unless they are special terms that are capitalized throughout the Recommendation in accordance with the conventions given.</p>

<p id="_59b2d968-fcdb-a5cd-0557-1baf4a1cbf68">When a figure is in 2 parts (e.g., Figure 6, part a and part b), refer to these parts in the text as follows: Figure 6-a, Figure 6-b. They may be referred to collectively as Figure 6.</p>

<p id="_2a89a3b5-ac0f-0b6c-a293-8c1666933f54">Figures and references to figures should generally be legible and understandable when using greyscale printing. It is helpful to remember that rich colours visible on computer monitors do not appear the same on paper and in the case of greyscale printing they often appear as black. To assure legibility, ITU-T uses 9pt Times New Roman font for text within figures.</p>

<p id="_27f55c91-0290-763c-63b1-fbbb49297ab6">If there are too many objects on a figure, it is preferable to break the figure into several parts.</p>

<p id="_9c95efe6-eb1e-2aa6-e630-b1ea9892d76f">To facilitate the editing process of figures, authors are encouraged to submit additionally an editable source file for the figures in their original format (CorelDraw, Microsoft Visio, Microsoft PowerPoint, Micrografx Designer, etc.) when submitting the final text.</p>

<p id="_f4f0dfff-ae95-ac74-a50a-466747552980">It is recommended that the figure index that is shown in the lower right-hand corner of the figure be preserved if a figure previously published by ITU has formed the basis of the new or modified figure. This index allows TSB to locate the source, which can reduce the time to publication by allowing the reuse of the foundation drawing.</p>

<title>Tables</title>
<p id="_49e326d5-b0ff-5484-1f64-9527393e45dc">Tables shall be numbered with Arabic numerals, beginning with 1 (within annexes or appendices there will be a letter-plus-period or a Roman-numeral-plus-period prefix). This numbering shall normally be independent of the numbering of the clause and of any figures. For Recommendations which are very long and complex, the author may number sequentially with respect to the single digit clause number. For example, Table 4-3 denotes the third table in clause 4 of the Recommendation in which it is contained.</p>

<p id="_dff3e93d-ab78-9d15-d861-76a33b267fdb">The number and title shall be placed on the same line and centred, above the table. The first letter of the title shall be capitalized; all other words shall not be capitalized unless they are special terms that are capitalized throughout the Recommendation in accordance with the conventions given.</p>

<p id="_807cb3bc-e810-d705-ac59-f1484e911f02">The heading of each column shall be bold-faced and centred, and its first letter shall be capitalized.</p>

<p id="_5d35615f-5012-f4f9-f4e0-bd6b8e897070">If the table is longer than a page length, the table number and title as well as column headings shall be repeated on each page.</p>

<p id="_6ebec8c5-f244-6218-1a35-4deb689decf6">If the table is wider than a page width, then each row in the complete table shall be assigned an index number. Each sub-table shall contain the index number in the first column.</p>

They shall normally be placed after the clause or paragraph to which they refer.</p>

<p id="_3ef0fd21-bdee-4950-6782-5c13a7b1b6dc">In a numbered clause containing only one note, the note shall start with the word "NOTE", placed at the beginning of the first line of the note and followed by a space and an "em" dash.<note id="_e65c8a3e-10f4-793f-d83b-0e9c750d76d1"><p id="_5ef0b895-800f-bf22-63e2-638684cc754b">This note is an example.</p>

Regardless of whether they occur singly or in one or more groups, all notes within the same numbered clause shall be numbered consecutively (i.e., NOTE 1 –, NOTE 2 –, NOTE 3 –, etc.).</p>

</fn> may be used to provide information regarding a particular item, word or concept. They shall be indicated by a superior positioned Arabic numeral at the appropriate location in the text and shall be numbered consecutively throughout the Recommendation. Both the indicator and the footnote itself shall be printed with a font one or two point sizes smaller than the main text.</p>

<p id="_f8109437-ec67-2035-a981-a0701bc83250">If the same footnote appears repeatedly on the same page of the text, the text of the footnote should be removed after the first time it is used. Furthermore, the same identifier for the footnote should be used for each occurrence of reference to that note on the page. Should the same footnote appear multiple times across multiple pages, the same rules within each page apply as above; however, the footnote should appear with a (possibly) different identifier for the first occurrence on each page.</p>

<p id="_1a3c34ee-a757-c6a5-0851-cace3548a9bb">Notes to tables and figures shall be treated independently from footnotes and notes integrated in the Recommendation. They shall be located for tables within the frame of the table, and for figures, between the figure and its title. Notes for each table and each figure shall be numbered independently. Such notes may contain normative specifications. Notes to a table or a figure can be indicated alternatively by a superscripted lower case letter (see <xref target="fig3"/>). Both the indicator and the note itself shall be printed in a font several point sizes smaller than the main text. To assure legibility, ITU-T uses 9pt Times New Roman font for text within figures and tables.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="_fd5c8d87-a807-e6d5-a84e-6b4f89f28a12">A considerable amount of time is spent by study groups on terminology and definitions but the results can be duplicative and of inconsistent quality. Greater consistency is needed in the way definitions are drafted. In addition, consideration needs to be given to ensuring that definitions are drafted in a way that allows for automated compilation and processing of new definitions so that the ITU database of definitions can be more easily maintained. Annex 2 to WTSA Resolution 67 (Johannesburg, 2008) provides basic guidelines for the preparation of terms and definitions. This annex builds on that guidance to help study groups to adopt a consistent approach to terminology and definitions and also to address the requirements for automated updating of the terminology database.</p>

<p id="_273bd727-90cd-15a1-4396-5de6a9d085a4">Developers of Recommendations spend a great amount of time on terminology development. While it is important that definitions accurately capture the subject concept or term, experience has shown that terminology discussions frequently consume significant technical meeting time. One way to reduce unnecessary discussion is to use already-defined terms.</p>

<p id="_359da83d-3f63-faee-ecb3-5a9b78a7acd9">New terms should not be developed where an acceptable definition already exists. Also, already-existing terms should not be redefined. Existing definitions should be consulted before any new definition is developed to check if the term/concept has already been defined. Only if no satisfactory definition exists should development of a new definition be considered. When defining a new term/concept, the name used for the term should not duplicate the name used for an already-defined term/concept.</p>

In order to reduce costs, outdoor electronic equipment cabinets (EECs) substitute outdoor shelters for telecommunication systems. Telecommunication equipment (baseband units (BBUs)), power supply equipment, battery, temperature control equipment, optical transmission equipment and other ancillary equipment can be installed in these outdoor cabinets.Recommendation ITU-T K.35 (2018) gives the definition of electronic equipment cabinet (EEC), earthing, bonding, but it is not detailed. For example, the surge protective device (SPD) configuration in the outdoor cabinet, the setting of the earthing terminal (main earthing terminal, optical cable dedicated earthing terminal), and the bonding of the equipment in the cabinet are not specified in detail. It is difficult for users of standards to obtain effective specifications and guidelines.China industrial standard YD/T 1537-2015, Outdoor cabinets for telecommunication system, had defined EEC as "integrated access outdoor cabinet" and "base station outdoor cabinet" depending on the application situation. This standard provides more information on lightning protection and earthing.</abstract>      <status>        <stage>Published</stage>      </status>      <copyright>        <from>2020</from>        <owner>          <organization>
