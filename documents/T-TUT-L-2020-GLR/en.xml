<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="_a0ae782e-84ec-1cf8-f629-ea336c417e4a">Working Party 2 of ITU-T Study Group 15 is entitled "Optical technologies and physical infrastructures" and is responsible, among other, for studies covering:</p>

<ul id="_207c0007-6cea-761e-7ed6-e438275f2dcc"><li><p id="_dc634537-3c6d-0355-1ba8-850967ad28e1">Characteristics of optical splices and connectors as well as other passive optical components that are needed to support outside plant applications (Question 7/15),</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_f117e545-a00f-88f8-9a99-59198104cea5">Marinized terrestrial optical cables (Question 8/15),</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_97285bc6-21ae-c5cc-8496-3bfd0498fd12">Cable construction and optical physical infrastructures, including installation techniques (Question 16/15),</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_72e1c6ed-c105-1cdb-d161-ac38e74ff623">Maintenance and operation of optical fibre cable networks (Question 17/15).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p id="_e28c976f-f326-16da-91bb-68b3bdd9c1e5">Some of the specific subjects to be dealt with in the above four Questions are the following:</p>

<ul id="_37f154d4-cda3-0527-3a74-daa05277c614"><li><p id="_35f9b751-3911-e727-9541-00c85879a719">Construction of all types of terrestrial cable for public telecommunications, including marinized terrestrial cables and the associated hardware (optical distribution frames, closures, connectors, passive optical components, street cabinets, boxes, poles, etc.),</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_56dd428f-b525-7208-8bc3-3226399bca3f">Construction and maintenance of the telecommunication infrastructure. This includes interoffice, access and related building and home cable and hardware installations,</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_190104e7-3cee-99c2-f50a-8d09a09ed027">Installation, jointing and termination of cables,</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_59a7a084-c865-4633-d3f7-02807ff30d59">Procedures for safety of personnel,</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_aa3dbfda-c983-1a48-3cff-d108a64a5218">Disaster recovery.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p id="_f3e62b4c-a71d-d120-8b5e-533da4c8a823">Moreover Questions 16/15 and 17/15, responsible for studies involving all physical aspects of outside plant, have extended their scope to also cover building and home installations, construction, installation and maintenance of the cable plant, including internal cabling and hardware for termination purposes.</p>

<p id="_09cb68f7-9caf-3a5b-0b87-534b155ca49b">Other subjects for study include reliability and security aspects, cable performance, field deployment and integrity of installations also for mixed transmission media, such as hybrid fibre/copper cables.</p>

<p id="_2c13e952-d786-b909-b58c-597d6dda3a82">In this way, the complete chain of cables for interoffice, access and related buildings and home applications are standardized.</p>

<p id="_9e70d86b-4ee6-c465-4126-e5f8739cf3b8">The activity on the construction of infrastructures addresses the investigation and standardization of all new techniques that allow faster, cost-effective and safer cable installation, also taking into account environmental issues such as the reduction of excavation, the problem for traffic, and the generation of noise.</p>

<p id="_e46a5dde-88fc-78e5-4468-f72a65eef165">On request of developing countries, where creation of telecom infrastructure is underway to fill up digital divide, a particular effort has been devoted to the study of installation techniques in remote areas with lack of usual infrastructure, taking into account the mitigation of the considerable risks and/or issues to which the optical fibre cable may be exposed.</p>

<title>Trajectory of the activities on the L-series Recommendations</title>
<p id="_c75c68ec-6f38-0b4b-fc3e-4084acb862b3">In 1957 CCITT established Study Group 6 under the chairmanship of <strong>Mr H.L. HalstrÃ¶m</strong> (Denmark), and with the following mandate "Protection and specifications of cable sheaths and poles".</p>

<p id="_61dbfa21-d4c0-0cd7-7667-d25e77abaec0">In 1961 it was renamed as CCITT Study Group VI. In 1969, <strong>Mr J.R. Walters</strong> (United Kingdom) took over as chairman of the SG, followed in 1977 by <strong>Mr J. Pritchett</strong> (United Kingdom), and in 1981 by <strong>Mr K. Nikolski</strong> (USSR).</p>

<p id="_218c6b3b-64ae-5583-9316-8123917f95ad">In 1985, the Study Group (SG) was renamed to "Outside plant", still under Mr Nikolski chairmanship.</p>

<p id="_c4a7c146-ae16-c998-1754-158ddaac6900">At the dawn of the CCITT era, the study group became ITU-T SG VI, and retained its title and chairman.</p>

<p id="_f98dabf4-81ac-8226-d7ef-e7a35761c094">In 1997, <strong>Mr Molleda</strong> (Spain) took over the chairmanship until 2000, when he was succeeded by <strong>Mr J.R. Osterfield</strong> (United Kingdom).</p>

<p id="_b3052009-9cdc-0358-47ca-4fe755bf9761">In 2001, according to the provisions of WTSA 2000 (Montreal), <strong>Mr F. Montalti</strong> (Italy) became the chairman of Study Group 6 that in 2005 changed its name to "Outside plant and related indoor installations".</p>

<p id="_1adc77e4-1488-b13d-1b7c-bc3fe62642be">In 2008, according to the decision of WTSA 08 (Johannesburg), Study Group 6 was disbanded and its activities were shared between Study Group 5 and Study Group 15. In Study Group 15 they were grouped in Working Party 2 under the Chairmanship of Mr. F. Montalti.</p>

<p id="_19985188-965c-cb0f-82fa-9510c4b429c5">In 2012 this organization was confirmed by the WTSA 12 (Dubai).</p>

<p id="_1e53241c-a290-e675-64bc-d6186edd8552">WTSA 16 (Hamammet) confirmed again this organization under the Chairmanship of <strong>Mr N. Araki (Japan)</strong>.</p>

<p id="_08006ba0-f0fe-a274-8ee5-70aab9018900">Since 2016 the new numbering system for technical classification of L-series Recommendations has been adopted.</p>

However, in metropolitan areas it is difficult to increase the number of ducts and/or tunnels because of the cost that it would involve and interference with traffic. Installing optical fibre cables in sewer ducts is one possible way to solve the duct shortage problem. However, the sewer pipe environment is different from that of ducts designed for telecommunication. Therefore, the required characteristics also differ from those for standard underground cables. <br/> This Recommendation describes the characteristics, construction and test methods for optical fibre cables to be installed in sewer ducts and drainpipes. The characteristics that a cable should have for an optical fibre to perform appropriately are described. Also, a method is described for determining whether or not the cable has the required characteristics. The required conditions may differ according to the installation environment. Detailed test conditions need to be agreed upon between the user and the manufacturer concerning the environment in which the cable is to be used. <br/> Amendment 1 to this Recommendation provides a new Appendix describing a national experience related to the subject. This Appendix, as the others in the main body of the Recommendation, may be useful for readers who intend to install optical fibre cables into specific sewer ducts (e.g., high water pressure and corrosive materials).</p>

The velocity of the moving air propels the cable causing it to advance at a typical speed supported by the blowing equipment. <br/> When using blowing techniques, there is generally no pulling force at the front end of the cable. The airflow exerts a distributed force along the entire cable. In addition, connection to a pulling cord is not needed. <br/> Generally, the blowing force is an order of magnitude lower than the typical force involved in other installation methods, for example pulling techniques, thus reducing installation hazards. Additionally, with this technique, bends in a duct run are of less concern than with pulling techniques, so generally, the installation speed increases, and longer lengths of cable can be installed. Cables are installed with low stress levels, leaving the cable or other elements effectively relaxed in the duct once the installation has been completed. <br/> Therefore, cables can be designed with lower tensile capabilities than cables to be pulled. Elements without additional strength membersâsuch as fibre units, micromodules, and single fibresâcan also be considered. <br/> New generation cabling techniques, based on microduct cables, microduct fibre units and microduct systems, offer the possibility of branching without the need for splices. These techniques are extremely flexible and make them possible to grow in accordance with demand. This gives rise to the concept of "fibre on demand", which involves the pre-installation of a multi-microduct system and then the subsequent, incremental installation of fibres based on individual customer demand. <br/> To support this "fibre on demand" approach, a fibre cable product must allow the installation of only a few fibres at a time. These types of cable products should take up the smallest possible amount of the service provider's right-of-way (i.e., fit the smallest microduct) so that there is plenty of space to add fibres for future customers. Therefore, usually only a small number of the fibres that are installed are used immediately. The latest fibre technology can also be adopted when required. <br/> This Recommendation describes characteristics, construction and test methods for microduct fibre units and microduct cables to be used with the blowing installation technique. The cable characteristics required for a cable to perform appropriately are described. Also, a method is described for determining whether or not the cable has the required characteristics. The required conditions may differ according to the installation environment. Detailed test conditions must be agreed upon between a user and a manufacturer for the environment in which a cable is to be used.</p>

This technology also has the advantage of using a necessary cable (ground wire) for communications. <br/> OPGW also has the advantage of using the ground wire of a power line for communications. However, users of OPGW need to be aware that if the cable fails it may not be repaired quickly. Therefore, an alternative routing for the optical circuits needs to be considered. <br/> These cables consist of a nucleus containing optical fibres and an armour generally composed of one or more layers of aluminium wire, Aldrey metallic wire, steel wire or aluminium-coated steel wire.

This Recommendation describes this trenching technique, which allows the easy installation, in narrow trenches, of underground optical cables and mini-cables in ducts or mini-ducts or directly buried. This type of narrow trench allows the use of reduced dimension machinery in small sized roads, typically those in cities, producing a lower quantity of waste material and so should be used in urban areas. This technology is mainly characterized by the simultaneous work of a suction machine and a trench saw, which allows for the possibility of opening and closing the work site the same day.</p>

Moving air force pushes the cable and makes it advance forward at a typical speed supported by the equipment. <br/> Generally, the tensile load on the cable is an order of magnitude lower than the typical force involved with other installation methods, like pulling techniques, reducing installation hazards. Additionally, with this technique, bends in duct run are not as important a matter of concern as they are in pulling techniques, so that installation speed increases and longer lengths of cable can be installed. Cables are installed without virtual stress, leaving the cable relaxed in the duct upon completion of the installation. <br/> There are several variants of installation: with/without a piston at the front end of the cable, or with a leaking piston. For variants without a piston, there is no pulling force at the front end of the cable: air flow exerts a distributed force along the entire cable. In addition, the connection to a pulling cord is not needed. <br/> This Recommendation describes air-assisted methods for installation of optical fibres cables in ducts. These methods can be used to install microcables or microelements into microducts, or jacketed cables into ducts or conduits. Installing conditions and equipment required should be different in each case.</p>

One of the main issues is the terminal part of the network with the introduction of optical fibre cables into building up to the apartment with technical difficulties but also administrative ones. This Recommendation deals with the solutions which could be deployed to try to answer to building owners, operators and customers' needs. <br/> This Recommendation also refers to the single mode optical cabling in new and existing buildings. Clauses 5 and 6 explain the main constraints of a common optical infrastructure for several operators, offering FTTH services to customers in the same building. Then, the remainder of this Recommendation describes possible cabling solutions which could be deployed in buildings. <br/> The proposed building cabling allows access to each operator to optical fibres in the building. The main goal of the concept is to be able to share the optical building cabling among different optical access providers. <br/> The objectives are, on one hand, to reduce fibre installation and maintenance costs in the building (both at the customer premises and in the common parts) and, on the other hand, to reduce disturbance (noise, infrastructure works, dust, etc.) for inhabitants. The goal is also to avoid the possibility for an operator to somewhat "pre-empt" the optical link up to the customer in a building or to avoid cabling duplication if more than one FTTH operator is in a building.</p>

This is also typical for the initial lay out of copper networks for plain old telephone service (POTS). However, with the increasing demand for connections and bandwidth, operators often face the need to apply active electronics at remote locations. These active nodes cannot always be located inside buildings. This Recommendation focuses on the aspects of active electronics, located at outside plant locations. <br/> Active network nodes in outside plant have a number of characteristics that make their design and maintenance more complex than that of passive nodes:</p>

It is important that high-speed broadband networks be developed economically to provide such services to all subscribers. In order to provide these services in a timely way, it is necessary to construct optical access networks quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively. However, recent progress in the application of optical plant technology in local access networks has provided substantial technical and economical experiences in several countries. Considering this, the network design must take into account planning, construction, maintenance and operation. <br/> The development of optical fibre access networks for broadband services can largely be divided into four stages based on the increasing number of customers; namely the initial stage, the growth stage, the mature stage and the final stage. <br/> Here, an optical access network is defined as a network of optical fibre cables that extend from a carrier's central office to the cabinets, buildings, individual homes, apartment blocks or business offices for broadband services. <br/> This Recommendation describes the optical access network to be used in the design and construction of fibre to the home (FTTH).

The primary feature of a PON is that it realizes FTTH economically by sharing fibre access infrastructures, namely an optical line termination (OLT), fibre cable and branching component, between multiple subscribers. The branching component is one of the most important elements in a PON because its installation site has a powerful effect on both capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX). Therefore, the branching component installation site is an important consideration in designing this network. This Recommendation proposes considerations for selecting the location of the branching component in the network as a function of the scale of the subscriber density and geographical extent. <br/> This Recommendation also describes considerations for determining the installation site of a (fibre optic) branching component in a PON designed to provide FTTH.</p>

This creates an environment where a company must install, operate and maintain its network bearing in mind that other networks exist right beside it, or even at the same location. In several countries, it is also determined that the operators should share some parts of the network with OLOs, in a transparent process to the users. This is called unbundling of network elements or, in short, unbundling, and is a very complex task. Some new issues must be taken into account to allow the accommodation of those operators sharing the same location to do so without problems. To guarantee an environment where operators interact but do not affect the quality of service provided by other operators, legal, regulatory and administrative statements must be followed by the correct technical solutions, which assure the network integrity, easy use of equipment and access to security.

As traffic increases, higher capacity fibre cables are installed. Recently, optical fibre cables with over 100 cores have become common, so many transmission systems use the same optical fibre cable. Minimal levels of maintenance and testing are required to provide high reliability and quick response. <br/> After a cable is installed, functions like fibre monitoring and control must be done without interfering with the data transmission signals. By monitoring dark fibres (that is, without signal traffic) an indication is given of the performance of the in-service fibres as the degradation and breaks that a cable undergoes affects all fibres in the same way. Nevertheless, greater reliability is achieved by monitoring the fibres with traffic. Also, fibre identification is important to control fibre networks because several fibres may have to be chosen from within a cable, even if the cable has many fibres in-service. <br/> This Recommendation deals with outdoor optical fibre maintenance support, monitoring and testing systems for both trunk and access optical fibre cable networks.

The number of FTTx subscribers is increasing rapidly. Trunk line communication traffic is also growing quickly due to the expansion of FTTx services. To meet the demand for increased transmission capacity, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and distributed Raman amplifier (DRA), technologies have been employed in trunk line transmission systems, and consequently high power communication signals and high pump powers have been introduced into optical fibre cables. If reliable optical cable networks are to be maintained, the study of optical fibre cable maintenance systems that can be applied to optical fibre cable carrying a high total optical power must be undertaken. <br/> When DRA technology is applied to WDM systems, a high-power light is launched into optical fibres and fibre-optic components. The intensity of that optical power reaches several watts, and such a high-power light may induce damage in optical fibres or fibre-optic components. <br/> During maintenance work, network operators must handle optical fibres or fibre-optic components carefully in central offices that employ high power systems with a view to preventing accidental eye or fire hazards. Since the light with the highest optical power is launched into the optical fibre distribution systems and the maintenance systems in a central office, clarify the effect that it has on the fibre-optic components in these systems must be clarified. <br/> This Recommendation describes the functional requirements for optical fibre cable maintenance systems for optical fibre cable carrying a high total optical power.

The number of FTTx and mobile subscribers is increasing rapidly, and a large number of optical fibre cables are being installed daily to meet the current demand. During the installation and maintenance of optical fibre communication networks, field engineers must first correctly identify a specific fibre from a bundle of fibres to avoid the incorrect cutting and/or connection of an optical fibre at a worksite. In particular, engineers should distinguish "live" (signal-carrying) and all dark fibres, since service reliability must be maintained. Therefore, it is very important to employ optical tests that distinguish a fibre for identification in an in-service optical fibre cable with no degradation in transmission quality even if the field engineer selects the wrong fibre.] <br/> This Recommendation deals with important considerations with respect to the requirements for an optical fibre identification technique used for construction and maintenance work in optical access networks by detection of leaky light waves. <br/> This Recommendation:</p>

<td valign="top" align="left"><strong>External additional protection for marinized terrestrial cables</strong> (10/2002)<br/> This Recommendation describes the external protection devices which can be utilized during/after the laying or during/after the reparation of marinized terrestrial cables (MTC). A marinized terrestrial cable is an underwater optical fibre cable, based on a conventional multi-fibre terrestrial cable core construction and protected to withstand the marine environment. It is designed for unrepeatered applications, that is, without underwater line amplifiers, hence without the need of power feeding for submerged equipment and has been tested for use in non-aggressive shallow waters, with a varying repair capability. The difference with respect to a repeaterless submarine cable can be found in the definitions given in ITU-T G.972. <br/> Cables are designed with a predicted lifetime, taking into account either cable replacement or a certain number of repairs. For shallow-water cables, the probability of failures is higher than for deep-water application due to environmental phenomena (for example, sea-wave motion, underwater earthquakes and landslides, etc.) and human activities affecting the seabed (for example, fishing, laying and maintenance of other services and cables). <br/> In addition to the various armour usually adopted for the cable construction â for example rocky armour (RA), steel wire armouring such as single armour (SA) or double armour (DA), additional external protections could be adopted if needed. Such protections can be applied both approaching the coast in shallow water and on shore in the portion between the water edge and the beach joint, or along the cable route where external factors or seabed features could damage the cables.</td>

<td valign="top" align="left"><strong>As-laid report and maintenance/repair log for marinized terrestrial cable installation</strong> (01/2002)<br/> This Recommendation describes the documentation/information that companies, involved in the installation, maintenance/repair of marinized terrestrial cables, should provide to the purchasers. In proximity of the landing points there are often many cables coming from various routes. In the shore-end portions, the cables and related protections such as burials, articulated steel pipes, etc. are closer and closer. Moreover, often the actual route is quite different from that foreseen as the laying reference route, as designed according to the various surveys, and the related documents are not updated. This situation could negatively affect subsequent installations and maintenance operations of cables and other services. In order to update charts, the national hydrographical institute, or any other local authority, has to be provided with the as-laid and as-built cable route information both after completion of the installation works, and after any repair if significant route changes occur. This will enable the proper design of project routes for future underwater services and cables and allow safe maintenance activities over existing lines so that overlaying and plants damage can be avoided. <br/> The companies in charge of the installation of cables in shallow waters, especially close to the landing points of sea, lake and river shores, should provide the purchasers with an as-laid report after the completion of the work and a maintenance/repair log after any repair or replacement.</td>

<td valign="top" align="left"><strong>Markers on marinized terrestrial cables</strong> (11/2007)<br/> A marinized terrestrial cable is an underwater optical fibre cable construction, based on a conventional multi-fibre terrestrial cable core protected to withstand the marine environment, designed for unrepeated applications, that is, without underwater line amplifiers, hence without the need to carry electrical power and tested for use in non-aggressive shallow waters, with a varying repair capability. <br/> The difference with respect to a repeaterless submarine cable can be found in the definition given, for such a cable, in [ITU-T G.972]. <br/> The purpose of establishing uniform marking techniques and procedures is to facilitate repairs and restoration of telecommunications in the event of an accidental cable break or natural disasters. As such, markings and procedures contribute to the overall security of the MTC links. <br/> This Recommendation describes the types of markers that can be applied on marinized terrestrial cables (MTC) and related land cables (considered as part of MTC) in order to warn of approaching joints, transitions and/or any relevant variation on the cable that can be useful for future inspections, cable protection and/or repairing. <br/> Both the materials and colours used for markers and their application points, are described.</td>

<td valign="top" align="left"><strong>Splice closure for marinized terrestrial cables (MTC)</strong> (02/2004)<br/> An important part of any installed underwater optical cable system is the jointing between different cable spans. <br/> In fact, it is very important that a splice closure utilized for an underwater (i.e., MTC) optical cable system is manufactured in order to guarantee not only a good quality of transmission during the expected lifetime, but also cost savings for maintenance purposes. <br/> A splice closure comprises a mechanical structure (closure housing) that is attached to the ends of two or more underwater cables, and a set of boxes (organizers) for containing and protecting the fibres and passive optical devices (if any). <br/> As a rule, the closure housing and the armour terminations, generally designed for a whole MTC family, should be dimensioned for the strongest cable designed for that particular link (maximum tensile strength and maximum pressure resistance). <br/> Splice closures for MTC applications may contain fibre splices, mass splices and passive devices. <br/> Moreover, since such closures are typically mounted on the cable before it is installed, it should also be designed to withstand all handling and loads that occur during cable installation. <br/> This Recommendation refers to both the design and the main characteristics that an underwater splice closure for MTC should have in order to be suitable for this application, as well as to guarantee the expected lifetime of the whole transmission link. <br/> This Recommendation also provides the tests for characterization and evaluation of the underwater splice closures performance, including mechanical integrity and optical stability of the product simulating the effect of the environment (water), as well as interventions related to installation and network maintenance.</td>

<td valign="top" align="left"><strong>Digital database for marine cables and pipelines</strong> (11/2003)<br/> This Recommendation describes the nature of the information regarding marine cables and pipelines that should be maintained by national or regional government agencies which are responsible for marine shorelines, and the cable or pipeline installations that may either be present or added. <br/> Information about marine cable and pipeline installations can affect the cost of future installations or maintenance, including their environmental impact. At present, there is no global authority to maintain such information and the responsibility rests with individual countries. Given that information from multiple shoreline databases is necessary in designing new cable links, a standardization of the information that should be maintained will assist all participating parties. Such information is also useful in managing shoreline infrastructure when cables and pipelines are decommissioned, thereby allowing the possibility of reusing the space.</td>
